A somewhat shorter version than the one linked to at the beginning of the article can be found here. Those who reject it are cast into outer darkness with Satan and his angels, and the "sons of Perdition". Short answer: They trust that God is in control and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that His prophet is in charge of the restored One True Church. 18 But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without your[a] works, and I will show you my faith by my[b] works. 19 You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! 20 But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?[c] 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? 22 Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? 23 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.”[d] And he was called the friend of God. 24 You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. 

Burton goes on to define those works: From http://www.lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/prophets-of-the-restoration?lang=eng: 

And also, the lack of good works/righteousness as a sign of not really being Faithful is stressed in Matthew 15:8, which is heard in almost every Sunday School class I attended when I was attending the LDS Church. But later on in the article, Burton again teaches that works are a result of faith. But the fact remains that in LDS theology, works are required. Perhaps not as a way of "buying" our way in, but as a sign, in that, if we don't have works, it's a sure sign that we don't have faith. Often, the following is quoted as support for this belief.
