battle shoes of the preparation of the gospel of peace I may add to this list at some point, but I think the list as it is gives us at least a clue as to how God feels about us, empathizes with us, and cares about us. Let me conclude with some verses from the Psalms: 

We need not search the Gospels (or the epistles, for that matter) too hard to observe how Jesus was affected by individuals, groups of people, and even cities and situations. Here is a brief list (with my bold print): 

The important word in the last sentence is, I suggest, mature. Spiritual maturity in a church leader means in part that he or she is able to confront and refute false teachers with sound doctrine and teaching. In what sense, then, were they "receiving the Holy Spirit"? To answer that question, I again suggest what happens in Acts 8 is an outward demonstration of a truth which was not yet fully understood by the apostles, let alone the Samaritans! That truth is that the Holy Spirit indwells a Christian when he or she first believes, or is passed from death to life, or is born again, or is born from above. Remember, the book of Acts is a transitional book which bridges Christ's teaching on the Holy Spirit and the yet-future teaching of the apostles and writers of the New Testament epistles. It is obvious that human beings and animals have at least a few things in common: Then, looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, "You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me" (Luke 10:21). 

The Bible calls bad men (and bad women) who attempt to preach and teach God's Word with their own particular and sinful slant "false teachers." The task of mature Christian believers, such as elders, deacons, pastors, ministers, priests, and so on, is to be on guard for false teachers and to protect the flock from these predators, whom Jesus called "ravenous wolves" in Matthew 7:15; 10:16; and Luke 10:3.
