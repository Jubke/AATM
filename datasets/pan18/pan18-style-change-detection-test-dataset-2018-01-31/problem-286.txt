Similarly, if the bet is 500 into a 100 pot, a bluff has a return of (1/5)(-500) + (4/5)(100) = -20, and a value bet has a return of (1/5)(600) + (4/5)(100) = 200, which again has no benefit over betting just the pot size. So if a person knew this, they could increase their (negative)EV when bluffing by betting more, but there would be no EV change by betting more with value hands. It's a little bit arbitrary of a system but you could try something similar and I think it results in enough calls for the bot to start gathering information and adjusting. For over-sized bets, take the example of a bet of 200 into a 100 pot. When the human player is bluffing, the bot calls 50% of the time (loss of 200 for the human) and the bot folds 50% of the time (gain of 100 for the human) which comes out to an EV of -50 to be bluffing. When the human player is betting for value with a stronger hand, the bot will call 50% of the time (gain of 300 total for the human) and the bot will fold 50% of the time (gain of 100 already in the pot for human) which leads to an EV of +200 for the value-bettor. But if the person had instead bet exactly the pot of 100, the bot would have called 100% of the time and there would be an EV of +200, so the person gained nothing by betting more. Here's one possibility that I thought of that admittedly might not be the most optimal but I think it's decent and I'll give some reasoning for it: start out by calling 100% of the time for any bet up to a pot-sized bet and then for bets that are bigger than the pot, call at a rate of 1/(bet size/pot size). For example, in a pot of 100 if the bet is 200, call 1/(200/100) or 1/2 the time; for a bet of 500, call 1/5 of the time. When it comes to pocket nines or above, things change significantly. Well, obviously like everything in poker, the answer is: "it depends". What this means is that, unless you hit a set, the value of your hand will be low, especially if a multi-player hand. All this is obviously just a small part of the decision process. There are a lot more factors to consider. There are situations where it's a good idea to play pocket fours and other situations where folding Jacks makes a lot of sense... It depends on the action, how your opponent(s) play, is it tournament or cash, how deep everyone is and much more. I usually never play 22-55 unless I'm deep enough (at least 40 BB). When it comes to 66-88, the value increases a bit so you can play the hand a little more often. Let's strip it down to its core: Pocket pairs are good because if you go against an opponent that doesn't have a pocket pair, he needs to hit the flop/turn/river somehow in order to have showdown value. You don't have to connect to the flop to do this, because you already have a pair. Even on a good table with a couple in the pot and stacks behind on the button and not too expensive I would call mid suited connector or a mid pair. They are the type of hands you need to hit but could get a big payoff. You are not looking to push players off the pot. Say you come in for 3 BB the you need stack sizes of 24 BB (MINIMUM). If you typically raise with pretty wide range then you don't need to disguise aces. If you think you can get more action if you hit then 3:1? If you just smooth call then the pot is 27. You can lead out the flop for 27 and give them the same 2:1 You are taking the risk they did not hit and they believe you did hit. Now you only need to get a fold 1/2 the time versus 2/3 the time. Just check if there are flush and or straight draws you don't hit. If you held back and drew AA the next hand you are not even getting 4:1 against two random hands.
