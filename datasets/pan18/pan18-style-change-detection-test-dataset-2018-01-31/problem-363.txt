Which may be found in this video quoted by Hamza Yusuf, in Suyutis book Aljami' As-saghir, by Tabarani as well as Al-Bayhaqi and it also was declared as sahih by Albani. The prophet is the one that would explain for those who would "quarrel about anything", as you see in the verse. Today we cannot directly ask the prophet to explain what certain verses meant or how to act in certain situations.
