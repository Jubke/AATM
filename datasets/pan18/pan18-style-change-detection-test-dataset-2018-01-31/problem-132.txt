Using the wind: If you live in a windy area and you know the route you can Repeat attacks: If you are in a lot better shape you can launch a series of repeat attacks in quick succession. They may be able to hold on to one or two attacks, but stacking the attacks will eventually wear them out. 3) Hostile Tactics & Cheating Depending on how much you value your friendship (e.g., frenemies), there are also some hostile techniques that I have come across in races over the years. I document them for completeness sake to indicate what should generally not consider as a strategy. 

One of our club rides has attacks starting on a stretch with sustained 17 degree gradient. On a fixed gear with a tall gearing pretty much any rider would get tossed out the back due to the mechanical disadvantage. 

Of course this is one person's experience and therefore not a canonical answer. There are a lot of factors, other than frame size, that govern fit, but 48/49cm is likely a good starting point for someone 5'2". 

We can also have some nasty sustained head winds. Again a fixed gear with tall gearing would be a suffer fest. 

PS. Quitting your job happens when the nice hobby becomes an unhealthy obsession. That said, others would argue you have simply dropped the shackles of societal expectations and become a free spirt. All I know is that my kids still need to eat. 

Now of course this assumes your listed average speed is an honest average speed. That is you started your timer, rode 90 km, then stopped the timer and found you averaged 29.5 kph. If by "average" you mean when you took the time to look at your speedometer you were often doing 29.5kph, then it is harder to assess. 

I suggest chatting up your local clubs, ask about their club ride policies and see which one best jives with what you want to do.
