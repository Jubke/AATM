Wives: Some women would be married and do whatever was necessary around the home. Making cloth and clothing consumed a lot of time which kept women busy. Many women would be unattached, being spinsters, free spirits or widows. Such women would work for a living being, well, spinsters (you guessed it) or knitters. There were usually certain professions set aside for single women, such as ale making. Many women were doctors/herbalists and harlotry was common. One of the first translators of Japanese works was the brilliant German polymath, Julius Klaproth. He made several translations from the Japanese in the 1830s, the first of which was of the Sangoku TsÅ«ran Zusetsu in 1832. This important book, first published in 1785 in Japan, had been brought to Europe by Isaac Titsingh who had made a manuscript translation from which Klaproth worked. The Soviet Government makes no claims to gold captured by the Allied troops in Germany. During the revolution the Bolshoi Russky were all killed systematically and the little Russians became assimilated into the population, so further studies of these matters is difficult. No, there were no reparations because the Allies assumed control of the government in Germany by the Berlin Declaration, therefore there was noone to pay the reparations. The Governments of the U. K. and U. S. A. renounce all claims in respect of reparations to shares of German enterprises which are located in the Eastern Zone of occupation in Germany, as well as to German foreign assets in Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Rumania and Eastern Austria. Firstly, weapon technology is difficult to research because it is usually secret and gunpowder is no exception, so most important evidence is purely indirect; you have infer the invention from other evidence, such as metallurgical evidence. I guess I will weigh in here because the other answers do not fully explain the situation.
