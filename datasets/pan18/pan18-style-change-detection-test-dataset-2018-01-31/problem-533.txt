In 1986, in a move to encourage the growth of employee stock ownership plans (ESOP), congress allowed companies to deduct half the proceeds from the sale of company stock to ESOP. An enterprising individual did, taking a $600k loss but saving $2.5 million in taxes. In 1987, the IRS discovered that this tax change was going to cost them more than expected, so congress retroactively amended the law. In UNITED STATES v. CARLTON, the court found: 

Ever since Marbury v Madison, the Supreme Court of the United States has had the power to determine what is and what isn't constitutional, and to strike down (or roll-back) an unconstitutional law. 

Defamation law pre-dates the USA. 

They would conclude that the First Amendment to the Constitution was completely unrelated to slander (spoken) or libel (written) defamation of character. 

Another issue here, is even if it were unconstitutional, you would need someone with standing to bring the case to court. I doubt you can find an individual or legal entity that wants to pay more taxes, or a government agency that wants bigger budget cuts. 

It wouldn't be until 1964, when the Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan established a standard for proving defamation. 

Unfortunately, many people today do not understand that the 1st Amendment prohibits the government from curtailing your speech, it does not absolve you from possible civil damages or prevent private individuals from censoring you. 

Multiple laws allow for the negation or commutation of penalties. The courts may reduce a sentence, a Governor or President may pardon someone. 

So why is it that if the federal government has been giving money to a state for the past few years, it can't say that the state has to take some action if it wants to continue receiving funding? Why is that, and that alone, considered unconstitutional coercion? 

I don't understand the reasoning here. Suppose I. as a private citizen, been voluntarily donating money to the state government of New Jersey every year for the past few years, and then I tell the state government that I'll stop donating money unless they enact some policy that I want. Would that constitute illegal coercion? I don't think so. 

And I'm pretty sure that if I've been donating money to a private charity every year for the past few years, I can suddenly say that my future donations will be contingent on the charity doing X, Y, and Z. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Just to take one more example, if the federal government itself has been funding some scientist's research for the past few years, it can suddenly decide to place a new requirement that he has to comply with new guidelines if he wants to continue receiving funding. 

Another issue here, is even if it were unconstitutional, you would need someone with standing to bring the case to court. I doubt you can find an individual or legal entity that wants to pay more taxes, or a government agency that wants bigger budget cuts. 

The relevant constitution text: 

Defamation law pre-dates the USA. 

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was designed specifically to protect freedom of the press. However, for most of the history of the United States, the Supreme Court neglected to use it to rule on libel cases. This left libel laws, based upon the traditional common law of defamation inherited from the English legal system, mixed across the states. 

It wouldn't be until 1964, when the Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan established a standard for proving defamation. 

But, ever since Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court has decided that it is the ultimate authority on what is or isn't constitutional. They have ruled that tax law is exempt from that section of the Constitution. 

Ever since Marbury v Madison, the Supreme Court of the United States has had the power to determine what is and what isn't constitutional, and to strike down (or roll-back) an unconstitutional law. 

Ex post facto laws, meaning "after the fact," is expressly forbidden in the Constitution, Article I, Section 9 (Section 10 prohibits states from enacting similar laws)
