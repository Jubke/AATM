(quoted above verse in context that by publicity of that music and those artists, most probably, will spread fahash(immoral) music/songs etc, and most muslims sects consider music haraam, so...)

P:S: I know some rulings/Fatwas in favor of eating such dishes. But they also state to be on safe side avoid this. I personally will avoid such foods to be on safe side. 

Allah has ascribed some women to people other than their fathers in Quran: 

Many people believe that because alcohol is sensitive to heat, it is eliminated with cooking. However, not all the alcohol content of alcoholic drinks is removed with heat; it depends on the type and time of cooking. For instance if you add beer or wine to boiling liquid, then immediately remove it from the heat, 85 per cent of the alcohol content will remain. If you light the alcohol, as in flambé dishes, 75 per cent will remain. Even after simmering the dish for one and a half hours, it will still have 20 per cent of the original alcohol content. 

As long as people know (its not confusing) and we make it clear that this name in my name is not my father's name, this is totally fine. 

The same fatwa as above answers this question and the answer is no, it's not haraam. 

According to this fatwa, the answer to this question is no, it's not wrong. 

Predictions via calculations, observations, experience are fine. Read this fatwa, this is the same as the 2 links above.

This becomes an invalid question as the answer was no for the question above. However, attempting to obtain knowledge of the future via jinn/fortune tellers is haraam. Have a look at this fatwa. 

So, if these fantasy stories are true, what's the harm in telling them and what's the harm in believing them? But if these fantasy stories are lies, they should not be told and they should not be believed in. 

The Prophet said, "Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall. When He created him, He said to him, "Go and greet that group of angels, and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the greeting (salutations of your offspring." So, Adam said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, "As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi" (i.e. Peace and Allah's Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam's salutation the expression, 'Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,' Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.

Besides i don't get the point of adding wine or alcohol if you believe it will still evaporate 100%, there must have been some ingredients left. as stated here. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 

And same i am advising to you as in a hadees it states: 

Now making all this clear, one can say that this was not culture of prophet's time, so it's not islamic culture to take husband name(people knowing its husband not father). Yes, that's right, no one is calling it ISLAMIC culture, but forbidding(saying its haraam) is way too much. If someone rules that it is better not to take husband name, than it can make sense. But not totally forbidding this, when there is nothing like attributing someone else as father being done. 

Now, if we try to take some examples 

You can read a fatwa here about it. 

However, I'm not sure if I've fully understood your question, but it sounds like you're asking if it's OK in islam to lie?...
