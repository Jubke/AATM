The other culture I am part of considers this to be almost sin like, i.e. a parent never ever apologies to a child, no matter what, even in an accident situation or even if the parent wrongs the child and realises later that s/he wronged the child. 

I posted a thread previously about differences in cultures. Again, I am part of 2 cultures, and based on 1 of them, parents apologising to children is a very good thing, it is considered setting a good example and it teaches the child manners and also respecting them at the same time if the parent does something wrong and apologies to the child. 

Does Islam have rules for this, is it considered disrespectful to refer to your granddad as granddad, or is it disrespectful to refer to your granddad via his real name? 

Is calling people by their first name considered disrespectful in Islam? 

Does Islam have any rules about this? i.e. in Islam, are parents allowed (or encouraged) to apologies to their children if the parent wrongs the child somehow. Or is it considered almost sin like for parents to apologies to children if the parent wrongs the child in some form. 

It should be noted that mentioned killing of Banu Qurayza's men was carried out according to the Jewish Law (Deutronomy 20:10-14) not Islamic Shariah. Here is the excerpt from NIV: 

Footnote: (from Al-Dhahabi's summarization) on the criteria of Bukhari and Muslim 

Scholars accept the possibility of a hadith being 'wrong' based on its matn (the content reported). Al-Sakhawi (d 1497) quotes Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi (d.1200) in Fath al-Mugeeth: 

However, narrators may miss some important piece of information while reporting. This may lead to contradiction with what we know for sure. It is usually recommended to collect all reports on a subject to fill the gaps and see if the apparent contradiction is resolved. 

This particular chain of narration is broken; one narrator is unknown (majhool ). We do not know who heard it from Ali (r.a). Therefore, it does not fulfill a basic criterion of being a sahih hadith. 

Yes, this one is in Al-Mustadrak by Hakim. 

Every hadith you find against intellect or (find it) contradicting (well-established) principles, rest assured that it is fabricated. Therefore, you do not need to consider it i.e. do not take into account its narrators and do not look into their criticism. (Similarly,) if it is against senses and observations, or either in contrast with the Qur'an or Al-Sunnah Al-Matwatira (the well-established practices) or decisive consensus; such that it does not accept any other interpretation.

So in the first culture, if your granddad's name is John Smith, it is perfectly respectable to call him John, and would be considered weird to call him granddad. 

By saying something like "ohhh, sorry, are you OK"? 1 culture I am part of recommends this, the other culture considers this almost sin like. What does islam encourage? That parents are too high in their position as a parent to apologies to children, or parents should teach their children by apologising to them if needed to set an example? 

In the time of the prophet when the wars took place. How did the islamic soldiers fight? Did they just randomly swing their swords at their enemy or did they have some sort of fighting system which they practised?

Therefore, if you sure that hadith you have quoted has been falsified by modern day knowledge you may reject it as a prophetic saying.
