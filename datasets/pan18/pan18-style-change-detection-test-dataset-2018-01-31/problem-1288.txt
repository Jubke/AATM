In conclusion, the knowledge which came about with our first parents' one act of disobedience was neither intended by God nor was it in any way positive or good. Thanks be to God, however, he can wrest something good from something bad, and through the cross-death and resurrection of his Son we now know and are now assured that Keep in mind that all words are symbols. Language is a symbol system in which words (sentences, paragraphs, chapters, books) stand for, or substitute for, ideas, whether they be concrete in nature (e.g., "Ur of the Chaldees," "30 pieces of silver," "King Hezekiah") or highly abstract ("the LORD is my rock," "I am the bread of life," "you must be born again"). There are, however, at least two truly crucial baptisms in the Second (i.e., the New) Testament, and one is primarily metaphorical, and one is primarily literal. I say primarily, of course, because there will always be some overlap between the metaphorical and the literal. Sarah was equally to blame for her insistence that Abraham have a son by Hagar (not that Abraham needed that much persuading to have sex with an attractive woman who was probably much, much younger than Sarah!). Had both she and Abraham listened--really listened--to the promise God had made to them in Genesis 17:19 and 18:10, they would not have been in the pickle in which they found themselves in Genesis 21. There were others who baptized penitents who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, but their names are few, which suggests to me the relative unimportance of who did the baptizing and the importance of who was being baptized and why! Named baptizers included Paul, Ananias (probably), Philip, and Silas (probably). What a difference between Jesus' audience in Nazareth and his audience in Capernaum! Matthew gives us some additional information about Jesus' experience in Nazareth:
