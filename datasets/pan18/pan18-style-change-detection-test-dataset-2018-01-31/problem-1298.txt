Catholics (and Orthodox) do not dispute the uniqueness of Christ’s mediation, which is based on the very Incarnation. Jesus’ unique status as the One Mediator does not, they would say, prevent God from establishing lesser mediations subordinate to the first. Jesus, as it were, bridges the gap, opened by the sin of Adam, between God and man; that does not prevent him from establishing other “bridges” between himself and the men still on earth. Jesus, in fact, clearly did this by establishing the Church, and the Apostles to lead it. The obligation to attend Mass on Sundays and holy days is, in fact, an ecclesiastical law, found in Canon 1247: 

In summary, in Israel, so-called “sin” offerings were offered for transgressions agains the ritual law, not so much for offenses against the moral law. 

An excommunication can, on the other hand, be ferendae sententiae; that is, imposed as a penalty by competent Church authority. In the New Testament, of course, it is well known that Jesus calls God his Father and instructs us to do the same. (See, above all, the Lord’s Prayer, Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4; also John 20:17.) 

For those who follow the recommendations of John Paul II's Rosarium Virginis Mariae, which recommends praying the so-called Luminous Mysteries on Thursdays and the Joyful Mysteries on Saturdays, the Luminous Mysteries would be prayed on the following days (when they do not already correspond to Thursday): There is not a specific norm in the Canon Law (abbreviated CIC)—the law for the Western church—or the Code of Canons of Oriental churches (abbreviated CCEO)—the law for the Eastern churches), however Canon Law says, 

Aren’t the saints dead? Didn’t God forbid contact with the dead? 

Conclusion Hence, to summarize the answer to the O.P.'s question: 

I will attempt to answer this question from a natural-law perspective (to complement Geremia’s excellent Scriptural analysis).
