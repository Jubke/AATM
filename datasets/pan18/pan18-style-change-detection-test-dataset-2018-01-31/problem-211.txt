It's a process. Like anything else. If you play a sport, you know that you got better with time. No one (very few people) start out being the thing that they want to be - we all work to get there. I need a structural change ~ 80% of the way through my story, and am playing with adding another chapter. Expect to revise many times after you have something written. Don't give up. I started writing scientific papers in my 20s, and the first ones were very bad. I didn't know how to write them. I learned. I can now (30 years later) crank out a scientific manuscript easily. It involves identifying your messages, providing the context that the reader needs, and being willing to cut out anything that does not need to be there. The final product should be such that every word is worth its weight in gold. A typical word length for such paper is around 5000 words, and they are dense beasts. <- That is a scientific manuscript, not relevant to you except to give you context for my advice below. I feel like this sort of mindless writing-for-writing's sake has worked for me in other chapters, and interesting stuff has come out of it. But I have not really heard of it as a technique. And I'm definitely floundering with it today. I'll provide a few (non exhaustive) thoughts on 'how-to' details. This will vary from writer to writer. “Wait ... you were here yesterday -” Telling this scene in narration would be something like: Further, I struggle with this, because there appears to be multiple ways to 'show.' There does not seem to be an agreed upon way to show. But, on the flip side, this at least gives you options. You are telling, in your example, as written. Switching to fiction this year - for fun - for other reasons too - I can tell you that even though some of the rules have changed, others (drawn from above) are the same. Here is my advice:
