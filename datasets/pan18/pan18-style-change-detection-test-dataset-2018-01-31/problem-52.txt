Parts 8-12 are found on a table to the south-east of the Hidden Camp in Caldeum in Act II: I did a run through with a new character, noting when each of the conversations became available. There are a few that the exact point in the quest is not 100% because a friend joined and I didn't want to hold them up by running back after every single objective. Once you've heard a conversation, if it was missable, it seems to stay around in stead so until I go through with another character and don't talk to anyone, I can't be certain when exactly they can be missed. Leah's Childhood is an example of this - you get this conversation when she's following you during The Broken Blade, but since she was following my friend, I couldn't collect this one and later it was not available and as such would be missable however once collected, it was available until the end of the act so in these cases, there would be two points at which they become unavailable. 

Alternatively, you could go to "The Legacy of Cain," quest stage "Explore Cellar" - play the quest until you get to the checkpoint at the Cathedral. Every time I've been to this level, there's been a chandelier with 4 zombies (2 that die when you drop it, and two who have a sliver of life left) right by the entrance: 

The "hero" in this case is whoever you have currently selected in the character selection menu prior to clicking the auction house button. Auriel also explains this in a 4-part lore series titled "The Creation of Sanctuary" Nephalem are the children of mixed parentage - angels and demons who created and fled to Sanctuary to avoid the perpetual war between heaven and hell. "Sanctuary" is the primary place where the Diablo games take place, and all of the humans are descendants of these first Nephalem. True nephalem are able to tap into their supernatural powers. Not every "human" in Sanctuary can tap his or her supernatural powers, but the heroes in the Diablo series can.
