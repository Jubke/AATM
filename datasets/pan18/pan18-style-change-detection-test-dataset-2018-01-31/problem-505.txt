Calculated from the following resources: For Djokovic & for Lendl For the WTA, it is Serena Williams who first became world number one in the WTA rankings on July 8th, 2002 and last was world number one on May 14th, 2017. With a time span 2 months shy of 15 years, Serena Williams holds the record for WTA players in terms of longest length between first being ranked number one, and last. The similarities between these two players which make them ideal to compare are as follows: Roger Federer did not defend point totals in: Cincinnati (1000), U.S Open (1200), Shanghai (10), Basel (500), Paris (90), ATP World Tour Finals (1090) = -3890 points going into 2017 Australian Open swing. I am assuming OP means ending the year number one with the fewest tournaments played? As for that, the answer is a tie! In 1986, Ivan Lendl played in 15 tournaments, and in 2014, Novak Djokovic played in 15 tournaments. This would put each's point total going into the swings at - Roger Federer 2130, and Andy Murray at 2290. Rafael Nadal was first ranked at the top of the ATP Rankings on August 18th, 2008. The last time he was promoted to the top of the ATP Rankings was August 21, 2017. The length of time spent between his first and last appearance at number one in the ATP Rankings, was 9 years and 3 days. No other male player has a greater time span between first appearance at number one to his last appearance. Both players will have lost similar point totals going into each's AO swing- I find the best way to determine his ranking would be to compare his position with another player who has ran the course in a similar situation, and see what ranking the player had at the beginning of the Australian Open swing. The player I will be comparing with Andy Murray (later half of 2017) is Roger Federer (second half of 2016). Both Federer and Murray withdrew from their half of the year in the same spot in the ATP rankings: Federer- on July 26th, 2016 was ranked "3" in the world with a point total of 5945, Murray on September 6th, 2017 was ranked "3" in the world with a point total of 6790. Given Andy Murray's success in these tournaments last year, I'd imagine his withdrawal from these tournaments is going to be detrimental to his ranking. My reference for this information is here. However, if Roger Federer can reclaim his spot on the top of the ATP Rankings soon, he will have a time span from first to last of 13 years! Roger Federer first became number one on February 2nd, 2004 and if he reclaims his number one ranking relatively soon, his time span will be 13 years + however many months. According to Andy Murray's Facebook page: Because of these two criteria, we can make an informed judgement that if we were to estimate Andy Murray's ranking going into the 2018 Australian Open swing, he will be somewhere between 16-20 in the Emirates ATP Rankings. The +4 margin in rankings is largely based on the 160 point total difference between Murray and Federer for each's respective year. Roger Federer started the 2017 AO swing ranked 16. Andy Murray will most likely not defend point totals in: Beijing (500), Shanghai (1000), Vienna (500), Paris (1000), ATP World Tour Finals (1500)= -4500 points going into 2018 Australian Open swing.
