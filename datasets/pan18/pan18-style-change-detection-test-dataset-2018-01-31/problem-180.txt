I have a rhode gear trailer with a 100 lb capacity, similar to the burley and other brands, that attaches to the left chainstay (see image of hitch below). I currently have it attached to my heavy-duty commuter, and I am not concerned with any adverse effects that it might have. However, I am having so much fun with it that I would also like to attach it to my road bike, which has a steel frame built for racing.

The chain with the single-speed front sprocket will likely need to be replaced roughly every 5000 miles, and maybe every 2000 with the 2-speed front sprocket. But it depends on how hard you ride it, and in what conditions. 

The brakes (which appear to be relatively standard caliper brakes) similarly should be adjusted after 100-200 miles. Brakes do wear, of course, and further adjustment may be needed every 200-1000 miles, depending on how you ride the bike. This is something you can do yourself, but exactly how you do it depends on the style of the brake -- there are generally adjusters somewhere along the cable path that you unscrew to tighten the brakes -- you want the pads to be fairly close to the rim without touching. If the brakes get off-centered, where one pad is much closer to the rim than the other, you should probably have a shop adjust them. And when the pads wear down to the point that the metal holders threaten to rub the rims, the pads will need to be replaced (at a bike shop). 

If it were a steel frame and fork there would be no question -- steel lasts nearly forever, even when moderately rusty, and can take all sorts of abuse. 

Keep the chain tensioner clean (wipe with a rag) and well-oiled with chain oil. If it gets really cruddy you can spray it with WD40, wipe dry, then oil, then wipe again, then oil again, then wipe again. (Keep WD40 off the tires and finish.)
