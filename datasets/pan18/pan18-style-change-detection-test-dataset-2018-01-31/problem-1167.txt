Interrogative C probes specifically for [wh] - anything not possessing [wh] isn't visible to the probing operation. Intervention is relativised - only elements of the relevant sort count as interveners. This is a great question! I personally don't know of any NLs which mark the distinction morphologically, and i'd be very surprised indeed to find one that did. Suppose in a hypothetical language L, an anaphoric pronoun is assigned form A, and a cataphoric one is assigned form B. The distribution of A and B would have to conditioned by the linear order of A/B with respect to its antecedent, which may be at a potentially unbounded distance away. Syntactic/morphological rules just don't work that way - syntactic rules don't tend to invoke linear order at all, and morphological rules only invoke linear order to the extent that forms can be conditioned by adjacent material. Al is giving Mary a ring. !=> Al has given Mary a ring. In brief, whether speech error data is relevant to the question of derivational order in syntax depends on just how much explanation syntactic theory owes to a theory of linguistic performance. In general, talk of syntactic derivations as top-down versus bottom-up is understood to be purely metaphorical: the theory of grammar aims to explain static knowledge, not dynamic process. A forthcoming paper considers how to understand directionality of derivation for syntactic processing (and what that may imply for an adequate theory of syntactic competence). From the introduction: *Al gave Mary a ring for a year. I am wondering if there are any verbs/phrases that qualify both as ditransitive, and as atelic. The following shows the relevant tests. The satisfying verb/phrase should have the same * patterns as give w.r.t. ditransitivity, but * patterns with sleep and watch in the telicity tests. A complete answer will provide the evidence that the proposed word passes the test in these ways.

[no one] attended the meeting [but for John] We start with the following 'Numeration'/'Lexical Array'. I've only included featural specifications (which are given in square brackets) where they will be relevant to the derivation. Note that i'm also going to ignore subject-auxiliary inversion in the derivation. I also use bare phrase structure labelling, so no distinction between maximal projections and intermediate levels. Note that the exceptive phrase can't appear between the verb and it's object. It can appear here, however, if we just make the object a little heavier, licensing heavy NP shift: The answer to your question is that 'you' doesn't count as an intervener, since it doesn't possess a [wh] feature. Interrogative C probes specifically for [wh] - anything not possessing [wh] isn't visible to the probing operation. Intervention is relativised - only elements of the relevant sort count as interveners. (6) [No one] attended the meeting yesterday [but John] Since the subject is closer to interrogative C than the object, it counts as an intervener to wh-movement of the object, as attested by the ungrammaticality of (b). Going through the derivation might help. Since your question is framed in terms of the generative framework, i'll give my answer also from a generative PoV - specifically, from the PoV of the Minimalist Program, where movement is feature-driven. I presuppose i certain amount of familiarity with minimalism in my answer, so apologies in advance. The derivation of the string aabbccaabbcc is as follows: (5) ? [No one] attended [but John] [the meeting we all said we would go to] It's not that everything in English is nominative, it's simply that English doesn't have productive morphological case at all - although there are some remnants of the old English case system, such as in the pronominal system, and the who/whom distinction. Lack of m-case is hardly unusual typologically - neither Chinese not Dutch has it, for example. English does indeed rely much more on things like word order - generally speaking, languages with rich case morphology are 'non-configurational', which means that they display more flexible word order. English is conversely 'configurational', so it has a more rigid word order. As an aside, languages like Chinese are an exception - it has no case morphology and free word order. We call these 'discourse configurational' languages. Next we merge the subject, 'you', which satisfies the external theta-role of 'invite': (i) [Everyone] [except Sally] jumped into the swimming pool (ii) [No one] [except Sally] jumped into the swimming pool (iii) [All boys] [except John] jumped into the swimming pool (iv) ??
