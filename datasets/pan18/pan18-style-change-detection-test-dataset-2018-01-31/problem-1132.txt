Is it true that languages often don't distinguish (phonemically) between velarization and pharyngealization? If so, why? Are they acoustically similar? I see a few possibilities for what happens to /mjaw/: Of course, this doesn't require analyzing them as syllables. One could just define "mora" = "syllable", and express the rules as "syllables cannot take stress when followed by a vowel", "adjacent vowels must have the same pitch within a morpheme/word", et cetera. A very similar phenomenon occurs in Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan, where intervocalic /b/ is realized as [β̞]. For example, Spanish bobo /ˈbo.bo/ will be pronounced [ˈbo.β̞o]. Japanese similarly often realizes /b/ as /β/. Double-slashes or pipes — //ˈkæt z// or |ˈkæt z| — morphophonemic transcription In Japanese, syllables have an influence on pitch accent in some dialects, including the standard. Indicates a transcription that attempts to record the underlying sounds of morphemes, before they are combined to form words. This ignores sound changes conditioned on location, which may result in multiple phonemes, that get applied in actual speech. To illustrate, here, the final sound is written ⟨z⟩ (rather than ⟨s⟩ as in its pronunciation) because it represents the English morphophoneme //z//, used as the plural marker. //z// can be realized as /z/ (as in pigs or kangaroos), /s/ (as in cats), or /ɪz/ (as in horses). The posited morphophoneme cannot be an actual phoneme, because English distinguishes /z/ /s/ /ɪz/ in other contexts (like whores, horse, horiz(ontal)). (The choice of ⟨z⟩ for the transcription of this morphophoneme is arbitrary, but makes sense because it is realized as /z/ in the absence of the effect of an adjacent voiceless segment.) Consider a language that has a phoneme /b/ as its only voiced bilabial phoneme. Speakers will then often pronounce /b/ without complete closure of the airway, giving a fricative [β] or approximant [β̞] realization. Standard Russian vowel reduction Slashes — /ˈkæts/ — phonemic transcription Articulatorily, velarization and pharyngealization are distinct, but they are often conflated in linguistic analyses I've seen:
