The Prophet said that the poor person is not the one who asks or begs, but the poor person is the one who does not ask and show his poverty. 

The Prophet said, "The poor person is not the one for whom a date or two or a morsel or two (of food is sufficient but the poor person is he who does not (beg or) ask the people (for something) or show his poverty at all. Recite if you wish, (Allah's Statement): "They do not beg of people at all." (2.273)

First of all Fardh means obligatory, so when you enter the masjid and the Obligatory is in progress than you must, must, must join the obligatory salaat. Outside of this you can make the sunnahs or not make them, if you do not make them, especially the confirmed sunnah's you have not sinned but you just missed out on making a sunnah prayer and gaining more reward. 

Al-Firasi asked the Apostle of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam): May I beg, Apostle of Allah? The Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said: No, but if there is no escape from it, beg from the upright. 

Songs sung by men or females under puberty, with a hand drum is permissible. 

It was narrated from 'Urwah that he narrated from Aishah that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq : 

If you want you can make the sunnah after the fardh, but that will be missing the point, the Prophet may peace and blessings be upon Him made certain sunnahs at certain times, ether before or after the salaat, so it would be pointless to make a sunnah prayer that was supposed to be at the first of the salaat, you can just make the sunnahs and nafils after the salaat and maybe add on to that (meaning to add extra salat to that, Tatawu' prayer which is the same as nafil prayers, so just make extra nafil prayer if you want.) 

When the blood observed is determined to be nifās blood, praying and fasting should be ceased until the period of nifās is over or the maximum number of days are exceeded (varies by school of jurisprudence). When the blood observed is determined to be istiḣāda, praying and fasting should be continued, while observing requirements of purification for istiḣāda. 

From an Islamic jurisprudence point of view, after an abortion, the type of blood observed will depend on the age and stage the fetus is in at the time of abortion: 

Between 80 days and 120 days: The soul is not yet breathed into the fetus, but the creation of human features may have begun; therefore, the situation is contextual. If the aborted fetus has developed human features, the blood observed is nifās (childbirth-related) blood. Otherwise, the blood observed is considered istiḣāda blood. 

Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the funeral prayer for Ashama, the Negus, with four Takbir. 

When the body of the deceased is not present, funeral prayers may be offered in absentia in exactly the same manner (the four takbirat) as if the body was present. All the other tasks that can only be performed if the body of the deceased is present may be skipped. 

The above is based on the following hadith (partially quoted) in Sahih al-Bukhari under the books of beginning of creation, divine will, and prophets: 

More than 120 days: The soul is breathed into the fetus; therefore, the blood observed is nifās blood. 

We mentioned that: Our madhhab is that funeral prayers in absentia is permitted, and Abu Hanifa did not allow it. Our evidence are the hadith about the Negus, and it is authentic, and they [Hanafis] do not have a valid response [why it is not permitted]. 

First 80 days: Human-like features are not yet developed. The blood observed is considered istiḣāda (vaginal, non-menstrual) blood. 

Songs sung by men or females under puberty, with a hand drum is permissible.
