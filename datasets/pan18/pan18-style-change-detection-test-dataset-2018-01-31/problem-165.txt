If you'd want to retain interchangeability you'd need a new wheelset, rotors, cassette and tyres. Then you'd have options. 

I'm considering a dropper post but would only do this if I was able to mount a remote as I like the continuous flow of being able to change things on the go. 

Comparing the two bikes side by side there would be more examples where the specification levels are different and would justify additional costs (brakes, wheels, tyres, bars, saddle etc.). 

Is it better to ride downhill in the larger chainring (42T) on a lower gear with a tighter chain or in the middle (32T) in a higher gear assuming the ration at the end is roughly similar? 

So the price difference between the two bikes is $349, this would include: 

I'm not aware of where this is printed on the RD though so not so helpful. 

You would not have to change anything else on the drive train unless they were worn as running worn chain on a new chain ring can accelerate wear. However there are other things: 

You will need to consider a narrow/wide chain ring or some form of chain retention to avoid chain drops once you remove the FD. As the Avalanche doesn't have ISCG tabs an option would be similar to this guide from Bionicon. 

I' don't think Pikes would be your best option unless you were looking to spend a bit more on the bike. The Pikes are more at home on a more aggressive trail bike (Trance SX). You can get a 140mm Pike on the SX but I think you will find something else limiting the rest of you're bike as your riding gets more aggressive. You find all kind of things to replace such as brakes, drive train, shock, wheels and cockpit chasing a more aggressive bike. I would look to upgrade the whole bike rather than the fork. 

What are some options for a seatpost remote cables on frames without a pre designed route?
