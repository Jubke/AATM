The venerable Maximus explained, "We do not directly control whether blessings will be showered upon us or chastisements will befall us, but our good and evil deeds most certainly depend on our will. It is not ours to choose whether we are in health or sickness, but we make determinations likely to lead to one or the other. Similarly, we cannot simply decide that we shall attain the kingdom of heaven or be plunged into the fire of Gehenna, but we can will to keep the commandments or transgress them." 

This also echos the Leviticus scripture showing that God finds homosexuality detestable. 

Yes, you're absolutely right! Jesus never broke any bones. That's a fulfillment of the prophecy from Old Testament and it's written about in John. 

God gave us free will. He allows us to follow or turn away from him. God knows what we will do. However, we have the power to control our responses. If God forced our hand, we would not have free will! 

God allows us to either reap the benefits of following him or suffer the consequences of turning away form him. He knows beforehand what we will do, but we don't. So, he allows us to fail or succeed for our benefit. 

These verses clearly state that Sodom was destroyed because of they were haughty and did detestable things. While Ezekiel isn't clear which detestable things were done, the Genesis account only indicates rampant homosexuality (possibly alluding to public, homosexual orgies) as the cause for this phrase "detestable things". 

Or the less cynical variation: realize that sometimes a non-expert will need to do a lot of research. And they might still be wrong. 

You can view this in different ways. I think the three viewpoints I'm going to tell about all have their merits. 

The realistic answer (in other words, what I recommend!) All translations have errors. You should read different translations side-by-side (eg. using an online parallel Bible), and be careful with any translation choices that are found in only a few versions. 

The optimistic answer Warning: don't apply the following reasoning to sectarian translations, e.g. the New World Translation. Seriously. 

By asking what the Bible says, you know what you get. 

If you ask what God says, you hear what 

The ultra-cynical answer All translations have errors. Read the original, then. But some of the manuscripts have errors, too. And many things don't make sense to us, in a very different culture than which the texts were written in. 

So become a Greek and Hebrew scholar, a historian, an archaeologist, a theologian, etc. 

An interesting (old) story about this: 

These verses clearly state that Sodom was destroyed because of they were haughty and did detestable things. While Ezekiel isn't clear which detestable things were done, the Genesis account only indicates rampant homosexuality (possibly alluding to public, homosexual orgies) as the cause for this phrase "detestable things". 

However, as @Ollie Jones mentioned, the Old Testament for this is based on the Septuagint--an ancient Greek translation--rather than the original Hebrew. Because of that, it's not quite as reliable as going straight to the source. (In some situations it can be quite a ways off.) 

It's really not a denominational issue, per se, but a doctrinal issue or a simple preference. 

James White has broken it down into five primary reasons for sticking with the KJV: 

"How can that be?" objected Theodosius. "Did God foreknow and actually foreordain our deeds from eternity?" 

Those were the regulations for the lamb that was slain for the passover feast. There are many passages that relate Jesus to the passover lamb. This lack of broken bones is one of these connections. (This regulation can also be seen in Numbers 9:12.) 

God allows us to either reap the benefits of following him or suffer the consequences of turning away form him. He knows beforehand what we will do, but we don't. So, he allows us to fail or succeed for our benefit.

Practically, it's slow to do this for everything you read. It might suffice to do it only when in doubt.
