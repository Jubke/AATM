Over the past few months, I've found that I regularly need the ability to look up review tasks associated with posts, for things like diagnosing odd voting patterns, verifying that the queues are operating as expected, or tracking down rejected suggested edits. Third (and subsequent) kick that day (from any room!) blocks user from talking in that room for 10 minutes and raises an automatic moderator flag. This would then accomplish three things: It gives room owners a little bit of extra moderating power for their room only. It would automatically escalate abusive users to actual moderators if they got kicked enough. They could then be suspended entirely if need-be. It would automatically escalate abusive room owners to moderators if they're misusing "kick"... (may also serve to escalate from one moderator to the entire team in cases where such oversight would be appreciated) Necessary restrictions: "Nice to have:" While discussing this internally, RobertC made the point that we currently do very little within the system to encourage users who've lost their cool to actually take a break - even suspension has no guidance associated with it, and users who can't chat can still read the conversation that first raised their ire - even as it continues without them. If feasible, we may wish to consider... The kick-mute feature in chat is... Wonderful. Instead of letting rudeness or idiocy derail a conversation, savvy room owners and moderators can quietly remove the disruptive person from the room for a short time, and continue chatting without breaking stride. The person responsible gets a polite reminder to be considerate, and the rest of the folks in the room don't have to listen to someone being berated in public. It would get the question off of your site. It would allow the question to be re-opened on SO, if the people so desired. It would allow the question to be deleted on SO, if the people so desired.
