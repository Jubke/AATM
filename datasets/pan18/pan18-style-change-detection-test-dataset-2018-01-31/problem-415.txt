So, in your first scenario, Alice will only see the comment by Charlieâ™¦ (assuming he deleted within an hour of posting the comment and that the comment was for Alice). 

If this was not you, I suggest you look around at who else has access to your computer who may have done this. 

We were hit by a botnet causing the slowdowns seen earlier. 

And then, we hope you follow the advice and start asking better questions - at this point, this is up to you. If you ask better questions, you will not get blocked. If you don't ask better questions... well, you did get a warning, right? 

In the second scenario, Alice will see no comments. 

Hopefully this is something that will be easy/fast to fix/mitigate. 

Once a question that has been put on hold has been edited, it is placed in a reopen queue, for peers to review and (if deemed good enough), reopen. 

If there is anything you can edit in the post, do so (unless it is too minor); this will lift the restriction (once your suggested edit is approved) 

Has flagging recently been changed to allow more than one flag, is this a bug, or have I missed something?

Be quick though, after 5 minutes your vote will be locked in: 

Is this a problem with Stack Exchange's servers, or with my ISP? 

I've been trying to diagnose the problem in the JavaScript chat room; the transcript is here (the messages from then on, between myself and @OctavianDamiean): 

I'm just wondering what the community average is, across all users on Stack Overflow? 

I thought one could only flag a post once, and that after that it should display: 

I'm keeping a consistent ~10% rejection rate on my suggested edits (not that I agree with some of these rejections): 

Is it possible that I've had 100 audits? What could cause this discrepancy? 

I have reviewed 950 suggested edits, but when I expanded the Reviewer Stats on an edit I reviewed, I see that I've approved 524 edits and rejected 326 - a total of 850, not 950. 

Any advice much appreciated! Trying to chat is very difficult with constant timeouts. 

Here's an API link (using version 1.1, I know):

The long and short of it is that I'm getting major packet loss only on chat.stackoverflow.com.

The message is there to be read, understood, its links followed, read and understood as well. 

In the second scenario, Alice will see no comments. 

Since notifications are cleared after the answer was deleted, commenting on a deleted answer would indeed keep the notification, which is reasonable as only moderators can comment on deleted posts and users can see their own deleted posts.

I mentioned to the Community Team that the help center documentation on this could probably use some love in regards to "next steps". 

Once a full post-mortem of the event has been finished, it will be posted on http://stackstatus.net 

When an answer is deleted, only comment notifications to the OP left by the deleting moderator within that last hour will remain in the inbox. 

We are aware of the speed issues and are currently investigating.

But my flag summary shows that I've managed to flag a question twice (I didn't realise I had):
