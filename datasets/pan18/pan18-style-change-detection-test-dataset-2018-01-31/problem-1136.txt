The phones [dʒ] and [tʃ] are both fairly common, as far as affricates go. Voiced obstruents are generally less common than voiceless ones, and [dʒ] is less common than [tʃ]. I found the following article that describes some phonetic reasons for this tendency for sibilant affricates in particular: Phonetic explanations for the infrequency of voiced sibilant affricates across languages. Nonetheless, [dʒ] is still not really rare. (note: this answer is not complete, I am not a linguist and I have no personal knowledge of Chinese. I hope it is still of some use despite this.) But in other words, there is no *s reconstructed for the PIE form. Are there any historical linguistics hypotheses about the source of the rough breathing in these words (e.g. a prothetic *s- prefix that later weakened to a rough breathing, a shift [w] > [v] > [f] > [h], a sound change inserting /h/ before all word-inital /u/ at some point in Ancient Greek (that seems phonetically unmotivated to me, although I guess it's the most straightforward option), something like that). Apparent consonant changes I suppose another reason might be the apparent palatalization of /t/ to /s/ in these words (latent > latency). While palatalization is undoubtedly the diachronic source of /s/ in words ending in -cy, it is not obvious to me that we can explain the /s/ as the result of a synchronically active process of palatalization. The words concúpiscent, concúpiscence, concúpiscible seem to be irregularly stressed (at least, according to their dictionary pronunciations; regularized pronunciations apparently have been heard "in the wild") when compared to words like reminíscent(-ce), dehíscent(-ce), oblivíscible, immíscible, permíscible, not to mention a lot of other words with -éscent(-ce). This is somewhat like how some languages have geminate stops at the start or end of a word, even though gemination is not always audible in these positions (I am thinking of Swiss German in particular). Actually, the uvular stop in Semitic languages is often thought to have developed from an earlier "emphatic" velar stop. I think there are some extant Semitic languages where it is realized with some kind of secondary articulation rather than a simple uvular POA. The English "j" sound is a voiced postalveolar affricate, transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet as /dʒ/. It is indeed the voiced counterpart to the voiceless "ch" sound /tʃ/. This is because the anatomic phonetic theory is a complete fail. People perceive sounds not dependent on how they are articulated. It is possible to pronounce uvular and alveolar "r" in such way that a listener hardly could determine how the sounds were pronounced. Let's count how many phonemes I can recognize and produce. My native language is Russian, so my phonetics is based on that language with some additions. For sounds existing in Russian I will use the transcription system taught in Russian scools, based on Cyrillic, because IPA is not quite suitable for the case. tra̯nsprtea̯ti̯om act of carrying across IPA was not designed for languages with palatalized consonants, so it uses different signs when dealing with different languages. For instance, in Russian, Irish and German the IPA notation is different. In Russian and Irish it is mostly denoted by the IPA on the consonant, in German - with the following vowel. Even for Russian some palatalized consonants get superscript j as indication of palatalization, while others have separate characters, in some cases the both ways are permitted. IPA is just a mess. Lưu Vĩnh Phúc has explained correctly how the phoneme written as "d" is realised in modern Vietnamese dialects. But in the context of this question we also need to ask why the Jesuit missionaries who invented Vietnamese Latin script in the 17th century decided to represent this phoneme as “d” rather than as something else. Modern scholarship seems to favour the view that in 17th-century Vietnamese (sometimes called “Middle Vietnamese”) "d" did represent some sort of voiced dental stop. Of course, we do not know exactly how it was pronounced any more than how exactly Middle Chinese was pronounced. Comparative linguistics is mainly about establishing regular sound correspondences rather than about discovering the physiological rationale of these correspondences. I am not sure if there is a word for no. 3, but I believe you are on to a genuine problem. My experience is that native speakers of any language “hear” what they think they ought to be hearing (in effect: a phoneme) and not what their ears are actually telling them. We had a discussion very recently on another site about the Arabic word phonologically /dʒanb/, phonetically [dʒamb], meaning “side”. A speaker on Forvo was definitely saying it as [djand], with [d]. The non-native speakers in the forum recognised this immediately, but the native Arabic speakers were insisting that they heard [dʒanb].
