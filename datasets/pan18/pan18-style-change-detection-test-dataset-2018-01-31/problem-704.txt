The kid will be born tomorrow. I wish to know if feeding time is the right time to "talk" to him and read him stories? 

What qualities should be looked in a bedding for an infant to prevent the crib deaths? 

Does sealing the bedding with a strong polythene sheet provide any benefits or risks? 

Also, my parents say that while eating we should concentrate only on food and shouldn't even talk. I afraid that talking and story telling during feeding might turn out to be a bad habit(?) Is my concern valid? 

I am asking this because I have heard that kids fall asleep while breast feeding and I think my continuous chatter will not let him sleep. 

So, what is the appropriate time for story telling? At what age will timing matter considering that the child will consider it a babble initially? 

Infant will be on his bed, so how will I know that it is the time to change his diaper? Do I have to wait for his crying? Do I have to check every 15 minutes whether his diaper is wet or not? 

Yes! Research does indicate that hearing children who learn sign language talk more than their same-age peers. Here is a resource for the study.

I suggest that you try the Dr. Brown bottle that reduces air intake when swallowing as well as continue the medication and strategies you are already implementing. Hopefully this problem will resolve quickly. 

Understand that medication my not stop backflow, but it does stop or neutralize the acid (depending on the medication). The acid is the source of pain, esophagitis, erosion of teeth and food avoidance. Basically, it reduces the refluxing to "spit" and we often say, "spit happens". 

My son struggled with self-regulation early on and I think I could have gotten him off to a better start if I had known what I did not know. 

Of course, she may rebel against another nipple at first, but it may be worth the aggravation of changing. 

FYI: Here is a link to an exhaustive investigative work on the source of the MMR-Autism vaccine scare. It is lengthy, but very enlightening! 

You might research different nipples and find one that more closely matches the breast. You might try the Evenflo Classic Sensitive Response (silicone). This nipple works the cheeks and lips and is not for a baby with weak musculature. It does flow during pauses in sucking however. 

Sensitivities/allergies/intolerance, preterm birth, and autoimmune disorders are other culprits associated with reflux. The duration of reflux will vary from child to child and will often depend on the causal factors and how they are addressed. Reflux can and often does disappear by 12 months of age. It is common however for adults to have adult onset reflux from gaining excessive weight and incompatible diets as they age.

This article emphasizes that the immunization does not cause the disease, but it does appear to cause it to manifest earlier.

As a speech language pathologist, I also promote the use of sign language for children with severe communication deficits. It is also an effective strategy for teaching color identification and sight words to children who struggle with these concepts initially.
