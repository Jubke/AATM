In 2012, Craig MacLean, a British track cyclist and Olympic silver medalist was the sighted pilot for Anthony Kappes as they won gold in the 2012 Paralympic Games. For the first time in those games, the sighted guides of blind athletes were also awarded medals, and MacLean, although not himself disabled, became only the second athlete to win medals in both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This means that 66 - 2 - 1 = 63 penalties were missed. I recall Merlene Ottey, who represented Jamaica (1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000) and Slovenia (2004). She obtained 9 medals representing Jamaica: 3 silver and 6 bronze. 

I know this does not match the condition on only speciality that were present in leat 10 editions, but I think 8 editions is relevant enough to be noted. Also, I am answering taking the sport at a whole, since checking 35 sports is easier than checking all its specialities. 

China in table tennis seems to be the top one with 87.5% of gold medals over all specialities since its introduction in Seoul 1988! 

In Table tennis at the Summer Olympics you can see that Chinese players have obtained 28 out of 32 gold medals and 53 out of a total of 100. The other gold medals were for South Korea (3, two of them in Seoul 1988, the other one in Athens 2004) and Sweden (1 in Barcelona 1992). 

Szekeres represented Hungary at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, and won a bronze medal in the team foil event. 

If you want to see some graphs on something related, you can check Sport Dominance: The percentage of events each nation has won per sport, in where you see archery (4/4 by South Korea), Table tennis (4/4 by China), Basketball (2/2 by USA) and Synchronized swimming (2/2 by Russia) are the sports in which a specific country has been dominant in Rio 2016. It explained that the discoloration was caused by the pH level - or acidity level - of the water being "outside the usual range". 

Your criteria are also met in the women's 1500m, women's 5000m and men's 3000m steeplechase. But Fina stressed that there was "no risk" to athletes. This was unintentional, and caused by the pH of the pool being "outside the usual range". Quoting from BBC News: 

Given how easy it was to find those (I just started with the track and field events at the most recent Olympics and worked up through the distances), I suspect this is a not uncommon occurrence, particularly in the longer distance events where races can be more tactical. In particular, the "fastest N losers qualify" rule will tend to force qualifying rounds to be quick to give athletes the best chance of making the finals, but there's no such pressure in the final. 

In the men's 5000m, Mo Farah won with a time of 13:41.66, a time which would have placed him in the middle of the field in either of the heats. The fastest time was Dejen Gebremeskel at 13:15.15, 25s quicker than the winning time in the final. In the men's 1500m at the 2012 Olympics, Abdalaati Iguider ran 3:34.00 in the 2nd semi-final. The final was won by Taoufik Makhloufi in a time of 3:34.08.
