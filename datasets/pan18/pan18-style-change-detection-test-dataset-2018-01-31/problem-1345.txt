It should be noted that this is rather a "standalone" passage, in that there is nothing similar in Scripture, so it is unwise to base a doctrine on it. However, you could read into this: 

I don't wish to sound flippant but you don't convert anyone. God does. Having said that, our responsibility is: 

The only passage I am aware of is 1 Peter 3:18-20a: 

In addition to David's thorough answer, I would like to add (what I think) is the single most clear verse: 

Jesus didn't, because the word "Christian" only appeared much later. Acts 11:26c: 

We who are Jews by birth and not ‘Gentile sinners’ know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified. 

Salvation comes through faith, but salvation is not our own doing, but a gift of God. Salvation is not a result of works (but of faith). Faith, then, is distinguished from works. 

So, from one perspective (but not all) that takes a literal reading of Scripture, anyone can become a Christian--a mass murderer, a rapist, a thief, a greedy person, an adulterer, or someone who practices homosexuality. Once a person has come to Christ, though, God desires them to live a holy life and indicates that certain things should no longer be practiced. 

The question, however, really centers on what happens to those who reject Jesus. The answer to this does not differ based on whether one is a Jew or Gentile, though. 

The apostle John clearly gives the answer in this verse: 

As a child of God whose body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, God calls us to live a holy life. Such a life should be free from all of the things Paul mentions. Thus the thief should steal no more, the drunkard should become sober, the adulterer should be faithful to his wife, the greedy person should become a generous giver, and the sexually immoral should live in purity. 

Jesus is here preaching to dead people in hell (implied by "he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed") and He would not preach unless there was hope of their salvation. Note though that this is speculation and not a central belief of any mainstream Christian denomination (that I know of - but see @brillant's comments, below). 

Jesus didn't, because the word "Christian" only appeared much later. Acts 11:26c: 

God is perfect (Deuteronomy 32:4, Matthew 5:48). That's His standard and His requirement to be with Him forever. No human however is perfect (Romans 3:23). Jesus is God become man (John 1:14). Therefore, He is a (and the only) perfect human. Jesus offers to swap His righteousness for our sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). This is possible because He sacrificed Himself for us on the cross (Philippians 2:8). Therefore we can immediately, on turning to Jesus, been declared perfect (forgiven) in the eyes of God (Acts 10:43). As one of my friends once said, summarising the whole Gospel in seven words, "We don't reach Him, He reaches us." 

Paul speaks of the one who does not work, but believes--that person's faith is counted as righteousness. Thus, faith is not a work, but is contrasted with works.
