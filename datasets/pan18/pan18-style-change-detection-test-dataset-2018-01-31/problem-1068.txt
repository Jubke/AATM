It's clear from many facts that this town was strategically important, but it's not clear why this is so. Consider this map (actually I couldn't find a good map, so Google Maps would do fine too): 

In the middle of the 3-month long Battle of Shanghai, the small town of Luodian on the outskirts of Shanghai saw some of the heaviest fighting. After Japanese troops made successful amphibious landings along the northern coast, many Chinese troops fell back to Luodian, and over a 10-day period the town was heavily contested and changed hands multiple times. 

No single factor determines the outcomes of all battles and wars, this is true even for the most important one, logistics. 

So for a period of approx. 4 years, between the invasion of Jing province by Wu and the reaffirmation of their alliance, the three states of Wu, Shu and Wei could be said to have been at war with each other. 

In terms of scale (keep in mind the numbers are inexact and may be unreliable due to the age): 

If your enemy has notice of your approach and are on your side of the river, they can cross the river first, and then use verse 4 against you. If your enemy is on the far side of the river, and they have notice of your approach, they can deny your attack. If they don't have time to cross, they can use the river as a defense against encirclement (verse 3). 

Some believed that being close to over-pressure events (artillery, etc) could cause a head injury with the large helmet being force up and the tough leather strap breaking the neck. This was supported by more than one army regiment actually giving written orders to their men to not buckle up. 

Yes, they did. Not all, but a very many, especially the more veteran soldiers. I don't have time to get sources together, but will when I do. Reasons were varied. 

If you meet the enemy as they begin to cross, they may halt their crossing, preventing the attack. They may fire at you from the far shore. If you let only as much of the enemy force as you can handily defeat, cross the river, you can easily defeat them while the reinforcements attempt to cross to their comrades. This is a form of "divide and conquer." 

For a relatively brief period in China's Three Kingdoms era, the three states of Wu/Shu/Wei were actively fighting each other. For most of the rest of the time, Wu and Shu were allied in their resistance against the vastly stronger Wei. 

No single factor determines the outcomes of all battles and wars, this is true even for the most important one, logistics. 

Usually when a side fights on home territory, can field bigger armies that are better equipped and fed, then have they have better logistics. Yet we can still find plenty of examples of such sides losing, like Agincourt:

Having worn a 'steel pot' in my earliest army time, I will say the number one thing about it, by far is it is heavier than any other hat I ever wore on my head. When running, whether or not the chin strap was properly fastened, that pot would rock forward and back and side to side, taking my head with it, such that I was forced to use a hand to keep it in place regardless of the strap! Now, considering that the original strap was just a strip of some material that was itchy and scratchy, I can easily understand why soldiers wouldn't want it done up. Even the later straps, like I used, made of nylon and cotton webbing, would be quite the sweat magnet and end up very rough.
