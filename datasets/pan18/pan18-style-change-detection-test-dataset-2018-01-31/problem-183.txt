Finally, tubes for 27 x 1 1/4 tires are a different matter. You can use 700c tubes in 27 x 1 1/4 tires (The right size should be 700 x 28-32 ish -- the boxes will be marked accordingly depending on the brand). Also, riding on a flat tire is bad -- you can damage the rim and wheel that way. That being said, 27 x 1 1/4 tires are still made in plenty by brands like Continental, Bontrager, etc. so your bike shop should easily be able to order one for you in a few days, or you can buy them online. So, the mass of air in a tire of volume V and pressure P and temperature T is about (PV/RT)(0.8*28+0.2*32) grams. It may be better to write it as "P ((V/(RT)) (0.8*28+0.2*32)) grams" noting that V/(RT) is a constant for us. You can (theoretically) mount any 700x(something) tire on any 700c (ISO 622) rim. However, you need to make sure the frame (and brakes if rim brakes are used) can clear the tire without rubbing. Note that running at a high pressure leaves you vulnerable to other things like road hazards damaging the wheel. You want the lowest pressure such that the rolling resistance is negligible, you avoid pinch flats, the tire absorbs some of the nature of the surface and keeps you in control of riding (i.e. no bouncing). For a 300+ lb rider, this will be a pretty high pressure on many tires. Also, remember tires are supposed to deflect a bit (visibly when you're on the bike), but not too much. If they don't deflect, they're overinflated. As for overinflating, why would you overinflate? You will use a higher pressure with a narrower tire, but overinflating means putting too much air in. And this can be bad for the rim. The right tire pressure is not whats written on the sidewall of the tire -- in fact, you'll almost never use that much pressure. We have many questions on tire pressure setup, so I encourage you to use the search feature to look at some of them.
