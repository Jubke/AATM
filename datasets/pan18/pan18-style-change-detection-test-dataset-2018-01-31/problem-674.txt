If he wakes up in 45 minutes crying, repeat the cycle. Take him to the rocking chair, and wait for him to fall asleep again. Back in the crib. I haven't heard of four months being the magic time when gas pain goes away. Usually gas pain happens when the kid's stomach is adjusting to something new - breast milk, solids, etc. So it'll "come back" when you start your child on solids. If you don't want to change your eating habits, your options revolve around switching to formula (look for ones that go down gently; formulas give gas too) or just waiting it out. The baby's body may get used to it. Clarification: Don't begin by avoiding "known gaseous foods." You'll unnecessarily be depriving yourself and your child of nutritional variety. It is better to figure out what it is that you ate that particular day that might be causing gas. Do you eat orange juice with dinner everyday? Try it in a smaller quantity or skip it for a few days. Skip garlic one day - did it make a difference? No? Okay, put it back in your diet and try skipping cauliflower next. Think of it as a game ;) Once he is asleep, put the child in his crib. (Some people prefer putting the child to sleep awake, but this works best for me.) Also, purchase a portable playpen. When we are visiting relatives or travelling, we put our children to sleep in their playpens. They are very compact when folded, and secure like a crib for sleeping. If you don't want to kid sleeping in your bed, you must never force it do so either. The first time you do this, it might be very frustrating so do it on a night where you don't have work the next day. (Friday night?) The important part is to convince your child that no matter what happens, he is NOT going on your bed.
