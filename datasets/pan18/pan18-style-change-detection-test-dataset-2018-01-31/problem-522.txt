No. In some cities, e.g. New York City, they don't answer to either. Although the mayor can fire and replace the police commissioner there, individual officers are not obliged to obey the mayor. In other cities, the head of the police may be elected separately from the mayor. And the president isn't connected to local police at all. 

Rubio and Bush cannot generally donate their delegates to Kasich. There may be some state that allows that, but the more common way is for the delegates to become unbound. There are currently 330 unbound delegates according to Politico (the 178 then plus 152 more from Rubio dropping out). Kasich has 145 delegates. That would give a combined total of 475 delegates. So Kasich needs 762 more delegates and Colbert's numbers suggest that there are 941 left. 

Other states may have no threshold (like Iowa) or a threshold up to 20% (like the 10% in New Hampshire). States can also have a maximum ceiling at least 50% above which they turn winner-takes-all. Other options are to award delegates by congressional district or by direct election of the delegates rather than the candidates. 

Franklin D. Roosevelt definitely had the most overall at 3522. FDR averaged 290.8 per year, which is also the highest rate (comparable in magnitude in one year to the 291 and 275 that George W. Bush and Barack Obama had in their eight years respectively). 

Only Woodrow Wilson (1803 in 8 years) had more than 1715 executive orders total. It would be barely possible that almost all of those were in one term but unlikely. The source doesn't break down Wilson's orders by year, but it does list an order 1888 from 1914 and 2859 from 1918. Working backward, from Herbert Hoover's first order (5075) gives Wilson as ranging from 1547 to 3349. Even assuming no other executive orders, that doesn't allow for enough in either term. So unless there's a problem with the numbering, Wilson had fewer than 1715 in each term. I edited out some punctuation that looked like markup code from the quote. And added some spaces to preserve the original line breaks. I believe that WTA means winner-take-all, but I don't see it defined in the source. 

The Democrats have different rules from the Republicans. The rest of this post will only discuss Republican rules. 

In Iowa, there was no cutoff. The candidates who received no delegates did so due to rounding, not a cutoff. I.e. they had thirty delegates to award, so Cruz got 27.6% of 30, which rounded to 8. For a single four-year term, Roosevelt's first term (1933-1936) had at least 1715. Some of the 253 in 1937 may have been in the first term as well, as it lasted until noon on January 20th, 1937.
