Quoting Bidayat al-Mujtahid wa Nihayat al-Muqtasid: 

If a person deliberately does not recite out loud when he is leading the prayer, his prayer is valid but it is lacking.

The hadith which is used for the opinion that it is not obligatory is the following: 

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

However, in any case, loud or silent, your prayer is valid but it is better if you follow the example of the Prophet. 

Narrated Abu Salama bin 'Abdur Rahman: 

If a ruling is established in sharee’ah for a reason that no longer applies, and this ruling is in accordance with the fitrah or is one of the symbols of Islam, then it remains even if the reason no longer applies. Raml (walking at a fast pace) in tawaaf was originally intended so that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions could demonstrate physical strength in front of the mushrikeen who said: 

If a person is praying alone, he has the choice between reciting out loud or silently. He should look at what is more likely to increase his focus and humility in prayer, and do that. 

I will restrict this to the hukm of Sajdah tilawah only. Since, there is a difference of opinion also on where/when it must be done. 

Regarding number of Rakah, I don't understand what you mean by short. Taraweeh is very flexible with respect to number of Rakah and it is not restricted to any number. In fact the Prophet (salallahu alayhi wassalam) would not increase it more than 11. 

Authenticity of the hadith For the sake of documenting the hadith used as evidence, it was mentioned in multiple books with two chains of narration that are quite similar. Most of the rulings are that it is da'eef, or hassan at best, which means it cannot be used to derive a rule. 

So it is a matter of how we calibrate ourselves to receive said matters: a calamity may be to a reward in store that one could not have achieved otherwise through one's deeds, or a purification from one's sins in this world (which, by all means, is a much lighter punishment than on Judgment Day). 

Second, the most effective supplication now is: 

From the hadith in Sahih Al-Bukhari quoted below, we can see that 'Amr ibn Salama lead the prayers when he was 6-7 years old. If a child could lead the prayers, and it counts, then he could definitely pray behind you in a jama'ah (congregational) prayers. The condition is that said child should be able to pray properly and to actively participate in the prayer as would any adult. Refer to Islam Q&A Fatwa 155061 (in Arabic only) for more information. 

The hadith which is used for the opinion that it is not obligatory is the following:

They said that this occurred in the presence of the Companions, and no disagreement was transmitted from any of them. They were the ones who best knew the essence of the law. This is used in support of that view by those who rely on the opinion of a Companion when there is no other conflicting evidence. The disciples of al-Shafi'i argued on the basis of the tradition of Zayd ibn al-Thabit, who said. 

If a person is praying alone, he has the choice between reciting out loud or silently. He should look at what is more likely to increase his focus and humility in prayer, and do that.

This is substantiated by what is related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:
