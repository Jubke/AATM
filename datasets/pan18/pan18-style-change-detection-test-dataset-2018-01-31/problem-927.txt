However, your question was not "should" he be taken as evidence, but has he been taken as evidence. The concept that Greek philosophy was borrowed from the Egyptians is a central tenet of Afrocentric scholarship, and is the core premise of British scholar Martin Bernal's influential but controversial three volume work, Black Athena. The concept draws heavily on the work of the ancient historians Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus who did in fact take Plato's statements (as well as other ancient sources) as evidence of actual Egyptian influence. 

This one (linked) looks to be the latest edition of the one used when I took Philosophy 101 many years ago. If not, it still seems like an excellent overview of at least the classic Western Philosophical canon. You'd need to supplement it if you wanted non-Western philosophy and/or more recent thinkers. 

As Conifold alluded to in the comments, this is a well-known topic in philosophy, most closely associated with the great German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who called this feeling "the sublime". He uses this concept, which he sees as most directly related to the awe-inspiring qualities of nature, as a way of developing his theory of art, which he believes taps into similar territory in the human experience. 

Just in passing and much too long for a comment: Deleuze's thoughts on this may be aggressive -- but keep in mind that (as he says) the question "what is the use of philosophy?" itself is intended to be caustic or at least ironic. 

We'll go a little further in the reading than we did in the other answer just to underline this point: 

For background, here are the relevant remarks from Nietzsche and Philosophy (p. 106 of this edition): 

Finally, there is this popular collection of essays on the film (including one by Zizek) which may be worth looking at if you haven't already. 

He assumes that God would accept the sort of cold, calculating faith able to make such a wager seriously. 

In terms of philosophers to investigate, I might suggest a few potential jumping-off points. 

Occasionalism is the position that God is the true and "efficient" cause of all that occurs. Absolutely nothing happens, except through him, even when we appear to witnessing the demonstration of a law of nature, or indeed experience ourselves to be directly exercising agency over our activity. 

Plato's work is all written to communicate directly with different segments of his audience. It isn't hard to read in a good translation, although the unfamiliar cultural context can be baffling at times (as can Plato's uncompromising Idealism). Taken together, his Republic and Symposium are the foundational key works of all Western philosophy. Descartes' Meditations are quite short and very clearly written. I personally dislike Hume, but he's easy to read (and has a wicked sense of humor) once you get used to the old fashioned style. The literary work by Sartre and Camus is compelling just as literature, in addition to its philosophical merits. Kierkegaard is more poetry than prose, if you can get past that, he's a good read. Lao Tzu is elliptical and aphoristic --that's apparently a core feature of the Chinese language --but not hard to read (in a good translation). Ecclesiastes is very accessible. (Conversely, Hegel and Wittgenstein and to a lesser extent Kant and Aristotle, are notoriously hard to read, while Confucius is obscured by an excess of culturally specific references.) 

To directly address the headlining question: Why is it so hard to write a philosophy textbook. 

At this point I would suggest a general anthology of philosophy. There are many of these, and most of them have similar selections of work. The advantage here is that you're reading primary sources, not interpretations (although there are usually introductory essays to go along with them), and you're reading a large cross section of best-known work of the most influential thinkers.

For the perhaps more general problem of demons from a philosophical or psychoanalytic perspective, I might suggest looking at Reza Negarestani's Cyclonopedia for serious discussions of demons and demonology. Nick Land's work may also offer some insight into the problem; I might suggest Fanged Noumena, a collection of his essays.

Reza Negarestani may merit some attention with respect to this problem. The work I would point you to would be Cyclonopedia. To my mind he most directly answers to the terms of your question. 

You may find in recent philosophical letters (e.g., Collapse, in particular vol. 4) a pronounced focus on horror, to the point sometimes where it is even presented as a kind of ontological principle. Many of the works which I might identify as participating in this turn will offer readings of "Weird" literature, like Lovecraft or Mieville.
