The balls are cheap and any decent bike shop will have them. (Take a ball or two with you for the shop to measure.) If you replace any balls, though, replace all of them, since the old ones will be worn and not have exactly the same diameter. (And always get 2-3 more than you need, since you'll always drop one or two and not be able to find them.) 

Sometimes tires are hard to get seated properly when new (because, eg, they were hanging on a hook in the shop for months), but quickly "take a set" and are no trouble if you have to dismount/remount the tire later. (And I should have mentioned checking for broken spokes: First check that all spokes are tight, and if any are loose check whether they are in fact broken. It would be very unusual for a wheel to not "taco" slightly when a spoke breaks, and replacing the spoke should get it back in true with relatively little effort.) 

Some minor dents in a rim can be repaired with the proper equipment, but others require rim replacement. Well, sometimes the rim is visibly bent, especially if there are creases in the sides. But if not visibly bent, and you don't have an experienced eye, then you have to attempt to true the wheel and see if it trues up well. To use cartridge bearings you'd have to replace the hubs, or at the very least get a machine shop to machine the hubs to accept the cartridges (thought there's likely not enough "meat" to allow this). If you're convinced the tube is not twisted, slowly inflate the tire while you inspect the junction between tire and rim, all around on both sides. (There is generally a rib on the tire sidewall positioned such that it will be about 1/8" from the rim edge all around when the tire is perfectly centered.) With your hands, "work" the tire one direction or the other to keep this distance equal all around as you slowly inflate.
