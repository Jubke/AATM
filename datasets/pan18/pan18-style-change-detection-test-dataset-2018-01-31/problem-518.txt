This covers everything except debates in Commons Public Bill Committees, which have their own index page. 

In particular, what is the oldest piece of written law (whether statute, constitution, decree or similar) that is still in force somewhere in the world? 

It reveals that the bill's passage through Parliament looked like this: 

There is a website for searching the Official Report of debates in Parliament (Hansard). In particular, there is an index of bills which have been mentioned in Parliament, including an entry for references to the Freedom of Information Bill (and other bills of that name). 

Chapters 1, 4, 15 and 23 of the Statute of Marlborough 1267, an Act of the English Parliament, are still in force in the UK. 

Alongside that, what is the oldest law still in force which has been shown to still be relevant? 

(Quotes are from the above report; see also here, here and here.) 

UPDATE: Having researched this answer by using the aforementioned index of bills, it turns out that there is an easier way: the Act's entry on legislation.gov.uk already has a complete list (albeit without links)! 

One instrument of this justice retenue, the lettre de cachet was especially controversial. They were used (among many other uses) to imprison mad people or prostitutes without any basis in written law or sometimes to have people detained at the behest of their family. In this case, crime and punishment were just a matter of tradition and convenience, the king could in principle simply ignore them and if he does nothing, they are not illegal per se. 

The last time someone was sentenced for insulting the president in France was in 2008. That person held a sign reading “Get lost, you bloody idiot” (a phrase the president uttered himself a few months earlier) during an official visit in his town. France was condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for this and ultimately removed this provision from the law. 

Finally, there is also a law against “offenses [outrage] against the national hymn or the tricolor flag”, which has been compared to a kind of “secular blasphemy” by critics. Unlike many such laws in other countries, this one was enacted very recently (2003) following some controversies about the attitude of crowds when the national hymn was played at the beginning of football matches. It's not part of the aforementioned “law on the freedom of the press” and only applies to some public events (i.e. it does not prevent you from making fun of the flag or hymn in a cartoon or a song). 

UPDATE, Jan 2016: A subsequent Law Commission report found that chapter 15, and part of chapter 4, have now been superseded and can be repealed (though at the time of writing, this has not yet happened). Chapters 1 and 23 "appear to have continuing value". 

It reveals that the bill's passage through Parliament looked like this: 

They were considered for repeal by a Law Commission report in 2012, but were found to still be relevant.
