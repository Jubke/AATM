In both cases, the time leading up to the red line is characterized by a complete closure of the vocal tract by the lips (hence the term "bilabial stop"). In [b], during this time, the vocal chords are vibrating. In [p], during this time, they aren't. 

I voiced my own version of [d] in the same frame, and this is the resulting spectrogram and sound: 

Since you asked about that particular chart and the accompany voice samples, I took the samples and laid them out in Praat, a tool designed for speech analysis. Onset of voicing coincides with stop release. 

The top half of the visual representation you see is a waveform, a visualization of air pressure on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. This is the actual energy your ear picks up and interprets as sound. You see the exact same pattern here. The "stop" portions (the period immediately before the red lines) have flat waveforms and no voicing bar on the spectrograms. Onset of voicing occurs well before stop release and also fills up intervocalic (between vowels) stop duration. When you get presented with a sound you've never heard before in that particular phonetic environment, your brain just associates it to the nearest match. Your brain disregards the voicing before the stop release and notices that there is no aspiration duration, concluding immediately that it is also /b/. This is helped in large part in that in even slightly rapid speech, the English sound /b/ appears not as an unaspirated [p] but actually a fully voiced [b] (e.g., in the word tabs). 

Because of the exceptional examples in my dialect, a phonologist who believes in phonemes would have to concede that I actually have two separate phonemes, /aɪ/ and /ʌɪ/, in my inventory. There's no other way to explain minimal pairs like cider vs. sider and high school (the lexicalized compound) vs. high school (meaning 'a school that is high'). When I first mentioned all of these examples to a colleague of mine, she wouldn't believe me; she thought I was making them up. She finally came around when I pointed her to this Wikipedia article! In analyzing my dialect I would still posit a regular rule/constraint that keeps /aɪ/ from surfacing as [aɪ] before voiceless coda consonants, but such a rule would not be sufficient to cover all the cases. 

If anything, neck length is going to be more reliable than neck circumference. The length of the neck is determined by skeletal structure, so it is more likely to be in proportion with the vocal folds. In the opera world, conventional wisdom says that the stereotypical tenor has a short neck and the stereotypical baritone has a long neck. But even that metric is not 100% reliable, since ultimately the growth of the vocal folds is independent from skeletal growth and can be influenced by such things as testosterone levels. John Wells has a reasonable analysis for vowels using Lexical Sets -- groups of words whose vowel share the same sound. Different lexical sets may share the same sound, in which case they are merged. For example, modern (non-conservative) English accents don't make a distinction between NORTH and FORCE. Also, American and British English use a different sound for the vowel in SQUARE and several other vowels; most of this is due to a rhotic vs non-rhotic distinction. 

Likewise, you need to account for other splits in progress, such as the BAD-LAD split found in Australian English and American and Canadian English accents with Canadian raising. Lindsey transcribes 〈governing〉 pronounced by Kasia Madera as [ˈgəvnɪŋ] and 〈up to〉 as [əp tə] on his STRUT vowel page. Here, I can recognise the [tə] in 〈to〉 but am having difficulty identifying the STRUT vowels as [ə]. Is this because they are actually shifted slightly toward the [ʊ] vowel and thus harder to identify as [ə] (e.g. when comparing COMMA and STRUT vowel pronunciations), or is it my brain being trained to think that 〈up〉 is pronounced [ʊp] so does not hear the [ə] as a [ə]?
