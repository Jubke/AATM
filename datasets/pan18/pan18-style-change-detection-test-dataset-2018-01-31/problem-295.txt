It's called the "card removal effect" and it has implications for computing odds and it explains "weird" facts: Which can be compared to user "rphv"'s method (drawing 7 cards out of 52) formula: However as soon as someone speaks then things change... (oh well instead of commenting I may as well post this as an answer) So there are 72 possibilities out of 2 118 760 boards to come. Well, if you play four deals like with p = 0.20, there's still a p = 0.4096 (40.96%) that you lose the deal all four times (0.8 exp 4 gives 0.4096). Without taking into account the fact that the very act of seeing the flop with one or several other player(s) influence the distribution of the flop (*), here's one way how you could compute these odds: However the article you quoted is not correct or, at least, poorly worded. The article talks about what happens if you play 4:1 odds (doing an EV+ call by getting 5 to 1 on your call) and says that, mathematically, you'll hit your draw once if you run four deals like that. This can also be put as: "People do not fold AA" (neither KK, nor QQ, nor AKs, etc.). C(3,2) is 3, so starting from XY, there are 6 possibilities to make what you called the "big full house" (very nice hand btw) if the deal goes to river. But it is not correct to say that "If you make this call four times, mathematics says that you will hit your draw once". That's not what probabilities says. I've answered basically the same in another question here (*). The article is correct in the way it uses 4:1 and 5:1. Under their assumptions (actual value given their example is more like 4.2:1), you are "4 to 1" to make it while you are getting "5 to 1" on your money. I'd say that this is precisely because both are written / pronounced / thought of this way that it's convenient. http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/36/stt-strategy/lt-card-removal-bunching-effect-simulation-321075/ So you "only" have (1 - p), which gives 0.5904 (59.04%) chance you'll win at least one of the four deals. Contrarily to popular belief this effect is something that can be measured and some people have been doing just that: analysing billions of (online) hands and noticing that the flop distribution was definitely not perfectly random. If you check the Wikipedia article on odds, you'll see that they're explaining it like in the article you quoted: Once again: it's not much, but it's enough to, say, change AK from 47.61% underdog to a favorite with a bit above 50% chance of beating a pocket pair. "...If several players fold first, Ace-King suited is a favorite over most pairs. ...(snip)... The reason for this is that players are more likely to play hands having an Ace or King than those containing smaller cards. Therefore, as players fold, the probability of an Ace or King coming on the board increases" Barry Greenstein himself wrote, (page 150 of "Ace on the River"), the following: Indeed. And that is a very complicated topic. So if you start with a pocket pair, you have: p = 72 / 2 118 760 Probabilities says that with p = 0.20 and four runs you have: I may have miscalculated something here or there but this answer should give you the basic idea. Note that I did write some piece of code to try this and found both 6 possibilities when you start without a pair and 72 possibilities when you start with a pocket pair, while trying all the possible boards of five cards to come. Now if that fact can help a player or not, that is another topic altogether: I only know this AK example because it's a great example Barry Greenstein came up with... It's very complicated to model : ) So although in a heads-up game your AsKs is about a 47.6% underdog vs 8h8c, it becomes a favorite with over 50% to win in a 6 players game where 4 players folded. As I've already answered in another question, Barry Greenstein himself wrote, (page 150 of "Ace on the River"), the following: (13 * 12 * 4) / 133784560 = 0.0000046642... You're asking two different questions and they have two different answers. You know your two holecards, so there are 50 cards left (as far as you're concerned, you have no idea what your opponents have). There are C(50,5) ways to choose 5 cards out of 50, which gives 2 118 760 possibilites.
