Because of the vertical dropouts you'd still need to tension the chain somehow (the obvious way being a tensioner). 

If you do find something on the web, you'll first need to remove your existing cassette. To do this, you'll need an appropriate lockring nut and either a chain whip or a vice. Park Tools have a selection of nuts that fit just about everything that moves. If the cassette is either Shimano or Sram, you'll need one nut (FR-5, but double-check), if it is Campy you'll need a different one (FR-11, but double-check). In my experience, its a lot, lot easier to stick the cassette into a vice than to use a chain whip. As a tip, a Black and Decker workmate makes a great vice! 

Yeah, I managed to do this one one of my bikes once. There was no way I could brute force the chain from between the cassette and the spokes. 

@Alexander is right, there is no need to break a chain when you replace a bottom bracket. So your hypothesis doesn't make complete sense, unless maybe they were doing other stuff to the bike? 

I think there are only really two "chain" tools (i.e. tools with "chain" in their name). One is used to break a chain, and goes by names such as chain splitter or chain breaker. So you'd use this for removing a chain completely off the bike, for example to replace it. You might also want to look at Power Links in this context, as using a Power Link means you can sometimes avoid using a chain splitter altogether (which requires a degree of precision). 

So the answer to "when do I clean it?" is also "it depends". 

As regards your last point, if you do start to "feel" something, then probably what you'd be feeling is damage that had already been done. I view lubing as preventative, so I'll lube on a time-driven basis rather than an event-driven basis.
