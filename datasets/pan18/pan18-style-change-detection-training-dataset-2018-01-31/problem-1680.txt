So supervenient emergence allows for the idea that the more abstract phenomenon is really a separate thing with its own rules even though it arises out of the more basic phenomena -- data may be lost in the process of emerging, but that may allow us to make independent observations we could not see in the more basic phenomena, and that may alter the way the emergent concepts should be thought about or used. Supervenience physicalism holds that all phenomena supervene upon (or emerge from) physical states. 

To my mind, this is still not a good basis for judging someone else's level of emotional expression - they are either physiological or environmental, not moral. Lower levels of physiological feedback are not a crime, they do not make you less human. Nor are very effective strategies for predicting and restraining responses a commentary on your humanity. 

This seems to imply an expectation that the absent dog is going to return, or that he can be found. It is hard to frame this as anything other than a real ontological belief in the existence of the dog, which is maintained contrary to mere evidence. Since jealousy is natural, and so is transition between lovers as our psychological needs evolve, we have solidified obligations in a way that does not allow for our longer lifespans and in the process we have extended childhood to a degree that creates fragility. A family, once attained, is overly permanent. It survives its own death, in the form of financial bonds that maintain a childhood that has been artificially lengthened by at least one third. So there are barriers to forming families 'prematurely' by which we mean "at the exact time in life that led to the most stable families throughout history." 

The notion is like the modern mathematical notion of duality -- the same thing presenting itself in two different forms -- than a Cartesian dualism -- the actual existence of two independent realms.
