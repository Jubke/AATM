To take the definition of Murabaha from Wikipedia: 

Some scholars also consider dishonest trading as riba, like price fixing or hoarding goods. 

Another good reference on Riba. 

In this case, if you're not lending or borrowed money, you shouldn't be worried about it. Even if the value was different, if you are not bound to return it, it should be considered trading. 

If you lent someone 10g of gold at $100, and got 10g of gold back at $300 later, it is not riba, because the value is different, just that the value of money (which is unrelated) has dropped. If you lent someone 10g of gold at $100 and got back 11g of gold worth $100, then that is Riba, because you are getting back more than the value. 

There's a Nisab on Zakat which means that you have a minimum amount before you are obligated to pay Zakat. If your net worth would be negative, or below the Nisab amount, you're not obligated to pay (Zakatguide.org). 

Most Islamic companies do deal with shares, so it's halal. It is haraam if the company is selling haraam products, which I doubt is your concern if you're working for the company. So, I assume you're worried if it's Riba. 

But if you lent someone a sick cow and asked a healthy cow from him in return, it becomes Riba. 

This is to the best of my understanding; if someone can confirm or correct this, it would be helpful. 

Now back to the part where they ask you to buy something. Whatever the case maybe, the person is not forcing you to buy something. He is giving you a free ticket to a place in return for an indirect price. Now it doesn't matter if he's charging you directly for that service, what matters is that the service is not free and you have to pay for it one way or the other. This sounds like a tricky kind of business strategy, and usually it should be clear what you really pay for. 

This sounds like a bizarre analogy to me. First of all nobody in the world would do that. Mosque is a place of worship and I am pretty sure nobody would stop you from entering it if you wanted to go there for prayer. I don't know which part of the world you come from, but even here in the west where mosques are very few in numbers this is not the case.

To take the definition of Murabaha from Wikipedia: 

The "profit margin" is fixed, the purchase and selling price is fixed. In other words, it's reselling something of equal value at a higher price. 

The debtor would have to pay Zakat on their $85,000 (savings minus installments) in their bank account, despite having a negative net worth. Which would mean that they pay $2,125 of Zakat (2.5% of $85,000). 

Riba is basically what happens when you lend someone a product at a fixed value and then request higher than the perceived value for it. 

Some scholars also consider dishonest trading as riba, like price fixing or hoarding goods.

A definition of Riba, as provided in Sahih Muslim, Book 10, Chapter 19, Number 3846: 

In this case, if you're not lending or borrowed money, you shouldn't be worried about it. Even if the value was different, if you are not bound to return it, it should be considered trading. 

This is to the best of my understanding; if someone can confirm or correct this, it would be helpful.

There's a Nisab on Zakat which means that you have a minimum amount before you are obligated to pay Zakat. If your net worth would be negative, or below the Nisab amount, you're not obligated to pay (Zakatguide.org). 

On the other hand, let's they were to pay $98,000 off their loan off that year, leaving them with a loan of $102,000. This puts their savings at $2,000 (below the Nisab level). They wouldn't have to pay Zakat on this, despite having the same net worth. 

But if you are deceptively raising the prices through financial engineering, price fixing, or some insider information, like selling all your stocks when you know the CEO is going to step down, then the halalness of the money is questionable. 

Trading is not Riba... for example, if you bought a sick cow, nursed it to health, sold it back at a higher price, that is halal. 

For example, someone might have US$100,000 in their bank account (which is above the Nisab level) and holds a $200,000 loan. They pay $15,000 of that loan a year. 

If you lent someone 10g of gold at $100, and got 10g of gold back at $300 later, it is not riba, because the value is different, just that the value of money (which is unrelated) has dropped. If you lent someone 10g of gold at $100 and got back 11g of gold worth $100, then that is Riba, because you are getting back more than the value.
