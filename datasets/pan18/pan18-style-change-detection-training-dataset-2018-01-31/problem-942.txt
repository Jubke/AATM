That being said, the GPL 'kicks in' for anyone who conveys a covered work. Yes, Stack Exchange is required to provide anyone who asks a copy of the source code. There is no ambiguity there. But, it becomes a moot point when dealing with interpreted languages. The real question remains, though, which is where the heck are my keys? I still haven't found them. OpenSTV can ask that people pay $5 and download the software from OpenSTV, which they're doing. However, that practice does not make the software any less free than it is (referring to liberty, not price), anyone is free to distribute under the terms of the GPL. As this tends to come in in floods of up to hundreds of edits at times, a bit of cleaning up is needed after the spammer has been blocked. Generally, most are blocked after only a couple of attempts have been reviewed, but what remains is everything else that got in prior to the block being enforced. Earlier today I couldn't get to the store on time because I could not find my keys. That caused me to miss the opportunity to run over a golf ball, which would have bounced between a few buildings in Makati and eventually land in one of the fish ponds at the park. The community team patrols each per-site meta as they check in on individual sites. They (we) regularly do the following: Nothing identifies these from non-targets, a spammer has no way of knowing what's being watched more closely. It's not a perfect system, and occasionally things that we really do wish we had seen sooner don't come to light as quickly as they should have. But, given our size and sort of loosely-coupled organization, we do pretty well for the most part. It looks like OpenSTV changed to a more restrictive license sometime after 1.7 (which is the version we're discussing). This doesn't change the fact that version 1.7 is free software, as defined by version 2 of the GNU General Public License. There's also the bug and feature fairy, but you have to code PHP at midnight in a dark bathroom in footed pajamas in front of a mirror in order to summon her and the last person that tried it hasn't been quite right since. Yes, it is perfectly legal. You can not add restrictions beyond the GPL when using the GPL. That is to say, you can't stop people from exercising the freedoms that the GPL provides to end users. If it's spam, flag or reject it as usual - no other action is needed. If you see this message, the origin has been, or will very shortly be blocked (99.9% of the time, they have been). The system is just alerting you to the fact that you're probably looking at spam, so make sure to review it extra carefully. Then, while our error rate so far has been extremely low (less than 1%), it is a concern. The idea of this system is to interfere with sincere use of the sites in the most minimal way possible. The third is a problem because that sort of perceived hostility can be very detrimental to the community, especially if you cause someone to lose a privilege that they recently unlocked. It goes back to voting based on the quality and technical merit of the post, not the person that wrote it. This often manifests when someone sees one low quality post, then goes through the profile of the user that wrote it and down votes additional posts in short succession. We strongly discourage this, but generally only issue a warning if it's apparent that you were focused on quality alone.
