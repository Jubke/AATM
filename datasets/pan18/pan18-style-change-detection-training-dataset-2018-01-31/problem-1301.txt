State Level Each state may also have their own definition. For example, the state of Kansas has this definition in law (formatting slightly altered from original): 

I haven't been able to find committee rules on the Maryland General Assembly's website, but in the states I am familiar with there is no requirement for the committee to vote on the bill. Many (perhaps most) bills die in committee without any action. 

About HJ-6 The issue they are talking about in the video is House Joint Resolution #6 (HJ6). This resolution would ask for a Constitutional convention to be convened to discuss voting and electoral changes. 

Rules in the state of Maryland require a committee to work a bill before it goes to the rest of the chamber. If a bill can't get through its committee, it won't have a chance to be voted on in the rest of the legislature. 

The Code of Federal Regulations codifies federal regulations. It is law, but not in quite the same way as statutes are. The regulation mentioned above is specific to the Department of Justice. 28 CFR Sec. 0.85 mirrors this language, saying terrorism "includes": 

Although the committee chair has a lot of discretionary authority, the rest of the committee can force issues through. However, this requires support within the committee. Committee assignments are determined by chamber leadership, so it's possible that the relevant committees are strongly for or against any particular bill. This would make it difficult for a bill to be forced through a community. 

These protections apply to anyone subject to American law. This includes citizens, non-citizen residents, legal and illegal aliens, people living on military basis (whether U.S. citizens or not), and a host of other edge cases (such as foreign contractors who are subject to U.S. commercial law). However, it does not include people in other countries or who are otherwise not subject to U.S. law. 

A common carrier is defined in the same act: 

As long as Title II is on the books, they don't have a choice -it must be applied to all common carriers.

(Side question: I'm assuming that most Americans are aware of WWII-era internment, regardless of whether they approve of it or not. Is that an accurate assumption?) 

To clarify our position: Freedom of movement is a fundamental human right. No person should be denied their human rights on the basis of their nationality. 

Amnesty International is opposed to any ban on entry to a country purely on the basis of nationality or religious belief. Naturally this includes any restrictions on entry for Israeli citizens. We note that these kinds of restrictions have had a negative impact on the ability of our staff and our partners to research and report on human rights violations across the region. 

On the other hand, a couple of politicians have referred approvingly to internment recently, and conservative writer Michelle Malkin wrote In Defense of Internment. 

I'm aware that the federal US government apologised to and compensated Japanese-Americans who were interned or their descendants, and that there's a play currently in broadway about internment. 

So the government shutdown, at least as measured by money spent, is really a 17 percent government shutdown. 

What are the objections to allowing civil unions to be recognized nationally, regardless of the number of individuals, their sex, or their familial relationship? (isn't there something all sides can agree with?) 

The Senate has published through the Congressional Research Service the reasoning why you cannot recall a Congressman/Senator. (You might be interested in the Judical branches rulings on similar matters pg. 10 in the pdf, pg. 7 as printed) 

No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time. 

The organization, the99Declaration did meet in Philidelphia, PA at what they called the Continential Congress 2.0, not to be confused with the original Second Continential Congress. Of 800 people who voted for themselves to attend as representatives of their districts, only 78 attended. Although they mention in their list of grieviences that congressional representatives should not serve back-to-back terms, no recall is mentioned.
