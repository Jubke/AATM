This is contrast to offences which actively harm the opponents' ability to play should and hence should come under the guise of persistent infringement. Examples of this include repeatedly fouling opponents, encroaching at a penalty kick forcing a retake multiple times, consistently holding opponents at a corner kick before the ball is in play. 

If a substitute is sent-off before the match begins, they cannot be replaced with a reserve player who was not named in the line-up. 

In the current (2013/14) laws, this roughly corresponds to the following on p. 123: 

When it appears that an attacker is going to play a ball and other attackers are close to being offside, the assistant referee will focus on the offside line and use their peripheral vision to judge when the ball is last played. 

When a goal has been scored but the ball appears still to be in play, the assistant referee must first raise his flag to attract the refereeâ€™s attention then continue with the normal goal procedure of running quickly 25-30 metres along the touch line towards the halfway line. 

This is demonstrated on p. 38 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game: 

If there are assistant referees appointed for the match, the referee will receive help from them to ease any uncertainty. Whenever a shot is taken, the assistant referee should follow the ball all the way to the goal line (as it becomes the offside line when it moves beyond the second last defender). 

Whether a player is in an offside position or not is determined when the ball is last played by a teammate. This is described (albeit in a poorly worded manner) on p. 36 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game (emphasis on relevant phrases mine): 

Judging from your question, it seems that the attacker that the ball ricocheted towards was in an offside position when the shot was taken. If they weren't, there can be no offence.
