First mention (Page 36, Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct): The answer to whether these calls were "good" or not will likely be different depending on which team you're rooting for! Being impartial, I think the second call is a very good one. The first I think would be a good no-call (though, as I said, I think a foul was called against Neuer, which I would disagree with). http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/02/36/01/11/27_06_2014_new--lawsofthegameweben_neutral.pdf So a two-footed tackle itself is not illegal. It's only illegal if it is careless, reckless or made with excessive force. The reason why two-footed tackles are often punished is because they are more likely to be careless/reckless. The big danger is that you catch the other player's feet/ankles between your legs, which can easily lead to a sprain, twisted ankle, or (less easily, but most dangerous) broken ankle. For this reason, many players will tuck back one of their legs when attempting a slide tackle - both for a cleaner tackle and for the safety of the other player. As you can see, none of the fouls have anything to do with the ball. Many fans will claim that if a player gets the ball they can do no wrong, but that is not part of the rules. For the Fucile-Sanchez foul, that was called a foul because the referee deemed it a reckless challenge. It's hard to see on the replays I've seen, but it looks like Fucile comes in and lifts his trailing leg up, thus catching Sanchez's feet between his two legs. This can be very dangerous for the player's ankles. That's my guess as to why the card was given. As the wikipedia article says (at least now, Fillet's seems to say it was recently updated), a two-footed tackle is only penalized if it is careless, reckless or made with excessive force - the same language in the first rulebook citation above. http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en_neutral.pdf Short answer: Yes. Getting the ball first has no relation (in the rules) to whether it's a foul or not.
