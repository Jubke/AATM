Analysing S as a projection of Infl according to the 'rules' IP/I''> NP + I' and I'> I + VP (alternating with other 'predicates' like PP, AP, NP, etc.) solved the 'endocentricity' issue that sentential constructions had initially raised, kept and reinforced the X-Bar principles as one of the key 'modules' of the ensuing 'Principles and Parameters Theory' of the mid 1980's, and, at the same time, allowed for great flexibility in analysing predications, which is why many introductory textbooks of the 1980's and early 1990's adopted the IP analysis of the core sentence, if only as a pedagogical solution. Assuming that things in Greek are as the OP says (i.e., that o Janis sits in Spec VP, whereas the verb has ascended into Infl/Tense), and assuming the - now obsolete - theoretical framework he refers to (basically that of Barriers plus the VP-Internal Subject Hypothesis of late P&P Theory), in which Nominative Case is still 'assigned' by T, etc., there are ways to assign Nominative Case to a VP-internal subject in situ. The obvious one is via association of the VP-Internal subject with an empty category (possibly a 'dummy' or 'little pro', see below) in Spec T, under the assumption that, for Case (agreement, categorial, and thematic) purposes, both are links of the same (subject) 'chain'. That, of course, is a problem for beginning syntax students, who must remain alert to detect when their textbook is just omitting irrelevant structure its author accepts and assumes to be there, if hidden, and when it is opting for an alternative analysis that denies the existence of that extra structure, but, in case the OP feels she is being irresponsibly played with, let me quickly add that the possible uncertainties this state of affairs may induce are far from mere ‘collateral damages’ caused by a teacher’s or a textbook author’s pedagogical strategy. The grammars of Mandarin I have seen all roughly say that the time interval at which the state of affairs/event is described as not holding/having occurred is relevant, and in particular that ‘méi’ is used to negate sentences describing events/states of affairs that were not the case in the past, whereas “bù” is used to negate sentences describing events/states of affairs that are not the case at present or will not be the case at some future time. Hence, if we wanted to translate the English dialogue between A and B above into Spanish, one of the possibilities would contain the exchanges A: Parece que se odian. B: Sí, lo parece, and, in that case, the Spanish que-clause would reasonably be analysable as the complement/attribute of parece. However, that rendition of the English A<>B dialogue is not the only possibility; B might also reply Eso parece, where eso could just as easily be understood as a pro-form for an (in this case post-poned) subject, rather than an in-situ complement/attribute of parece. Unfortunately, under the traditional view that such that/que clauses are initially generated as complements of seem/parecer, that analysis leads to a serious theoretical problem, because the would-be unmarked construction (i.e., that in which the que clause is raised from its complement of V position and postponed, with or without an intermediate 'stay' at the pre-verbal subject position) actually requires more computation than the would-be marked one (i.e., that in which the que-clause stays put after parece and no further computation is needed). As far as I can tell, the term 'predicate' is used rather differently in syntax and semantics. Sentence (4) could minimally be derived (again, leaving all V-Raisings aside) by ‘long’ Subject Raising, but with the same potential objection raised wrt sentences (2) and (3). Pace Lawlor above, however, "to" cannot be a 'complementizer' ('Comp', 'C'), either, since a) it must follow the complementizer "for" and the accusative-Case subject that must nowadays accompany it (cf. "It was a mistake for him to tell his wife he had lost his job"), and b) it must also follow interrogative "wh"-phrases in focus that must, in their turn, follow complementizers (cf. "I don't know what to do" vs. "*I don't know to what do"). However, as P&P theory developed during the mid and late 1980's and the number of languages analysed within that framework increased, INFL inevitably revealed itself as a simplification, a cover term for an aggregate of different inflectional features, in particular, 'tense' (or lack thereof) and 'agreement', and, as such features could be neatly distinguished in 'phonetic form' in many languages, and could even appear separately in some, it soon became inevitable to insert them in syntactic trees under different category nodes. By 1988, largely due to Mark Baker’s influential work on the correspondence between verb morphology and syntactic projection, the Tense and AGR components of Infl were already distinct 'nodes' in all serious work on P&P syntax, and, to the extent that, in view of the morphological structure of verbs, AGR-S arguably is structurally higher than Tense, later P&P work by Chomsky and others between 1989 and 1991 started including analyses of the predicational core of the sentence as an AGR-sP(hrase), although eventually Chomsky himself retrenched into a simpler view that reduced IP to TP, for technical reasons that need not concern us here. Hence, syntactic predicates normally or even invariably (depending on the analyses syntacticians adopt), correspond to only one type of what semanticists would call 'first-order one-place predicates', the type in which the argument that must 'saturate' the unsaturated one-place predicate to yield a 'proposition' is discharged, precisely, by the syntactic subject of the clause, but, of course, the undischarged argument of an unsaturated one-place predicate need not correspond to the subject of the clause; semantically speaking, I sent Bill__ is also a one-place first-order predicate, even though the missing argument is, syntactically, not discharged by a subject, but by a direct object (say the invitation in I sent Bill the invitation, or which in This is the invitation which I sent Bill, etc.).
