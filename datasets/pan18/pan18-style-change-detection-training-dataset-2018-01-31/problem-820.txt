Let me attempt to summarize my notes. I took a class called "fiqh of food and clothing," and we discussed this issue under the "food" section. I assume you know already that eating/drinking haram, free mixing, etc. are all prohibited in any kind of event, and also here. 

So ultimately, we say, Allah knows best. 

From Usool ul-Fiqh, we learn that "all actions (which are not acts of worship) are halal until proven haram." The default ruling would apply here: you would assume that it's okay, unless shari'ah puts some conditions or exclusions on it. 

Birthdays are something many people in many cultures celebrate individually. If there isn't a shari'ee prohibition on it, then it becomes a question of culture. Therefore, if it's part of your culture to celebrate it, you have no reason preventing you from celebrating it. 

This would apply at all social gatherings, including sitting at tables which are mixed. This applies double if the sitting is in khulwa (isolation from others), such as a date. 

It's always nice to know that there were no pig carcasses involved in the production of your water, but I would call the certification overkill in this case. 

The best one can do would be to apply the advice presented in the hadith of God's pasture: by only narrating those stories which are clearly permissible (such as those in the Qur'an, those authentically narrated by the prophet, or those from the children of Israel) and avoiding all others, one can be sure they're not transgressing God's own limits, even if by accident. 

An extra consideration when using a hunting animal is that even if you say bismillah before releasing him, you may only eat of the prey if the animal hasn't eaten of it. This is based on a different hadith which states "if the dog eats of (that game) then do not eat it because the dog has hunted it for itself" rather than hunting it for you. 

However, it is incorrect to apply a general ruling such as "One must never tell such stories, nor believe in them," as there is no way of knowing that the stories themselves are not true. I know of no evidences to outright forbid such, especially if the following points are considered: 

As for "ahlul kitab" and people of the book, they are a brand of non-Muslims who have special favour in Islamic law -- we can eat their meat, marry their women, etc. Note that these are all personal actions. 

As to your exact question, why would there be an issue in questioning this? Scholars have written tomes on benefits of different 'ibaadat. In fact, rasulullah (salallahu alayhi wa sallam) said in one hadith: 

Therefore, what the shaykh recommend is simple: if you want to be safe, don't celebrate it. At the same time, if your kids classmates invite them over for a birthday party, or your extended family invites you, or your work brings donuts on someone's birthday, you have the option of participating or not participating. 

So again, sometimes we know, and sometimes we don't know, the reasons and benefits. We only need to submit; we can definitely investigate and find out if we are able to.

I had written an answer to a similar question on another site, which I am copying (with slight modification) below: 

After narrating the story of Companions of the Cave in the Qur'an, God rebukes those who attempt to guess at al-Ghaib. Arguing about the details about any such story, including details such as whether it's authentic or fabricated, is futile unless clear evidence is available. 

But even then, avoiding doubtful matters is still preferable. 

However, it is incorrect to apply a general ruling such as "One must never tell such stories, nor believe in them," as there is no way of knowing that the stories themselves are not true. I know of no evidences to outright forbid such, especially if the following points are considered: 

Of note, if the water is not actually pure bottled water, but rather some brand of flavoured/enriched water, there is an increased chance that the additives themselves are haram. Given that a number of common additives are of animal origin, the certification makes more sense in such cases.
