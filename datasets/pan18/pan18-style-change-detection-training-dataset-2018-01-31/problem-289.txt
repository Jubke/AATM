In my opinion, the advantage in brake modulation and power, not to mention consistency in all weather conditions far outweighs the the addition of a few grams. No pun intended. The difference is usually in the length of the threaded insert that goes in the frame, and that the caliper bolt threads into. The inserts are available separately, and must be sized correctly for the frame. There may be some older calipers where the bolt itself is too long, but a Ti/Carbon frame sounds pretty new for that. The Ultegra 6600 STI lever is available as a right hand only part. It should cost around $400 dollars for the right shifter only, and around $600 dollars for the set. ____________ 16mm _____________________________________________________ 22mm _________________________ The compatibility chart can be found here. They come in 16mm and 22mm lengths. A steel frame would normally use the shorter 16mm version. See photos. The photo below is a pre-release Shimano Hyddraulic STI lever seen last February on Rabobank pro rider Michiel vd Heijden's cyclocross bike. The Magura RT6 and RT8 Hydraulic TT brakes have been available (if somewhat unusual) since last year. They are a solid system which is compatible with most current TT frames. The RT6I've only seen as an OEM product. The RT8 seems to be the retail version. The weight comparison only becomes truly significant when you look at more basic bicycles, i.e. the $600-1500 market, because the cost penalties for premium parts, like truly light weight disc brakes and hubs, don't allow use in that market. Any loss of grip between the rear pads and rim, or any mechanical failure of the rear brake, will keep the front brake from operating, rendering the bike brakeless. In other words, the system eliminates one of the key safety features of other bikes with two brakes: redundancy in case of mechanical issues, especially in emergency braking situations where cable systems in particular are stressed the most. The design differences with modern pads are obvious. You get a huge simple block of rubber with no grooves. Nothing about the design of the pad is coaxing you to replace it any time before the metal part starts contacting the rim, a point that most riders will be able to see coming and all but the least observant will hear about the second it starts actually happening, before any serious damage is done. The simple option is to "burp" a little fluid out by removing and putting aside the pads, putting a rag up to the caliper bleed port, slightly opening the port, and resetting the pistons with the port open (again cleaning/lubricating the pistons first as needed). Some fluid will come out, which the rag is there to soak up before it makes a mess. Close the bleed port quickly when you're done of course. This usually works fine for all intents and purposes. You are reducing the boiling point of the brake fluid every time you do this as well as increasing its compressibility, both of which could hypothetically make some kind of meaningful difference at some point, but we're really talking about a very small amount of water. You also shouldn't try this if you're not prepared to bleed the brake in case something goes wrong. I'll add the disclaimer that I haven't actually done this on Clark's brakes, only on many, many Avid/SRAM brakes. Wear gloves and eye protection. The difference is usually in the length of the threaded insert that goes in the frame, and that the caliper bolt threads into. If you are looking at an aftermarket upgrade, expect to spend $1500 on new wheels and brakes, and often more, for quality, lightweight kit. The weight penalty has gotten down to only 50-100 grams in most cases, between a bike built with a high quality disc setup and a high quality V-brake setup. The weight comparison only becomes truly significant when you look at more basic bicycles, i.e. the $600-1500 market, because the cost penalties for premium parts, like truly light weight disc brakes and hubs, don't allow use in that market. In my opinion, the advantage in brake modulation and power, not to mention consistency in all weather conditions far outweighs the the addition of a few grams. No pun intended. The difference in weight is there, but hasn't really been significant for the last few years. Scott, for instance, is building a complete, disc brake hardtail with a 4" travel fork. Bike weight: 7.45 Kg, or roughly 16 lbs. That's 2 lbs less than my road bike. A theoretical advantage of this kind of system is for one-handed users, especially if the one braking hand available has compromised strength. Unlike split levers, they don't have the drawback that they're dividing one hand's braking force between two different brakes, since they're making use of otherwise-wasted energy to actuate the front brake. IS has one clear upside: all the threads are in a relatively cheap and easy to replace adapter. The disadvantages are that it's more mechanically complex and expensive since there's always an adapter, and the design of the standard is such that the same adapter doesn't adapt the same caliper to the same rotor size front and rear. A adapter for 180mm in the front is an adapter for 160 used in the rear, for example. Another approach is using one of the generator light brackets available that are somewhat intended to address issues like this by only adding a bare minimum of material behind the caliper. (Maybe you've already looked at this; I offer it in case you're running into the issue by trying to use one of the chunkier generator light brackets out there, such as the plastic ones.) An example would be the B&M 471F:
