I used the IGN planner to plan my skills: 

I use illusion and the fury spell. It's even better when you get silent casting, but until then act like a stealth archer. Sneak, fire fury, then run and hide. They will fight it out and one will probably die. If not, then repeat until one finally does. You can finish the straggler off with a backstab. 

What difference do power attacks make? 

I am playing a Khajit thief and I use light armour. Minor spoiler below: 

The benefits of heavy armour are: 

This means you can benefit more from the magic attributes below: 

The benefits of light armour are: 

Duel casting just increases the range of the path shown to your objective. Its probably about twice as long. Doesn't really make all that much difference however, 1 handed does the job fine. 

Are there any difference between 1 handed and 2 handed (duel wielded) power attacks? 

The thief guild provides you with some nice light armour. 

Using robes is also a very viable option, depending on your character set up. If you decide to go this route, I'd recommend going with illusion + alteration. 

I use double daggers and doing a power attack takes lots of stamina but doesn't seem to give me any advantages, other than a nice animation. 

You can actually take out a whole horde of enemies using illusion spells, without even getting noticed. Just let them massacre each other, stand in the shadows and chuckle to yourself. 

For a complete list of the change logs you can go to the change log. This patch is available through many sites like Nexus but is not available any longer through the Steam Workshop (this is due to restrictions in the Content Creator). I -highly- recommend getting comfortable installing the mod via the Nexus Mod Manager (simple easy to use interface that handles installing and uninstalling the files for you) as the Unofficial Patches are almost a requirement to play Skyrim bug free. 

Yes you can contract it multiple times You advance a stage each in-game day you do not feed. No, you have penalties at all stages, they are just extreme at the fourth stage. I would say no but this may just be my personal bent on the situation. Unless its for RP reasons, the penalties (specifically the regeneration issues when out during the day) make this status not worth it in my opinion. It would seem a better use of your items/blessings to just directly improve your stealth instead of having to try and compensate for this manner of doing so. 

In regards to the HD textures, its most notably active by the increased loading times. Also, you can see the difference if you stand still in the game.. Most motion makes the higher quality textures not so much better than the normal quality textures the game came with.. Great for screen caps, not needed so much for normal play... in my opinion of course. 

It is dependant on your build.

As a Vampire Lord you gain access to a skill tree with some perks in it. What happens to points spent in these perks if you are cured? Are they refunded to be spent elsewhere or are they used up permanently?
