My question, is this: "Can we justify the disciplining of children (or even mandatory education) by a parent/guardian?" Even though this may constitute a case of acting on a maxim that perhaps couldn't be rationally acknowledged by the agent towards whom the parent, for example, is acting. Would the child agree to his disciplining if he knew all relevant facts and would such a circumstance render the action morally justifiable in a Kantian sense? 

B) Rationality is our essence as human beings; and 

As a further point, it seems common sense that we should take care of children (perhaps in particular our own), however I wonder whether Kant provides a rational basis on which to justify what seems to be the positive duties to say, provide for our family, to nourish and protect our children. It seems that love is demonstrative, sometimes gratuitous and actually performed in an special kind of way. 

Perhaps I have missed something! Thanks. 

The only requirement that a rational agent conform to the Categorical Imperative comes from the fact that an autonomous will adhering to it would be considered rational, and an autonomous will violating it would be considered irrational. Since a will that chooses rationality over irrationality is a moral good, we ought to conform to the CI. 

However, these pure concepts of the understanding cannot be related to any particular objects or pictures in your mind, because they are the pure concepts, and any relation of them to a particular empirical intuition would inappropriate; the mere association of a pure concept with a sensible intuition would cause it to be "impure" (it would lose objectivity). 

This is not actually true. The way you word it in this particular passage it's not entirely clear, but based on your other responses to me in more than one question on this site, it seems that you are insisting that existence is an attribute or characteristic, when in fact is it not. If I am to say that ice cream exists, I am not adding anything more to the concept of ice cream; it is not a "characteristic" of the ice cream. It is only a relation of the object (ice cream) to the subject (me). 

Kant's Moral Philosophy at SEP covers this topic pretty well; check it out for further reading. I'm not overly fond of Wikipedia's coverage but it's a good supplementary read. 

C) To be essentially rational is to be bound unconditionally by the requirement of obedience (of the will) to rationality; 

A) We are each capable of acting 'on the basis of reason' (in accordance with the requirement of universal law); and 

B) Rationality is our essence as human beings; and 

Perhaps I have missed something! Thanks. 

With respect to the Formula of Humanity, if we accept that: 

How can Kan't moral schema account for this intuitively important active (rather than passive) quality to moral behaviour?

I know there are many permutations of questions pertaining to euthanasia, but in the interest of specificity, let's keep it to these two cases.
