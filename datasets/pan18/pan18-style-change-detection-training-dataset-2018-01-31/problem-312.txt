In general, we get better power, and hence speed up the hill, with a higher cadence. But this is not true for everyone, as at least one of the linked articles will show. 

The child seat I used was similar to the one shown in the question. Hands further forward on the drops, just touching the upward curve. This requires a different wrist position, but may be worse for you. Some people can reach the brakes, but on the Allez I don't think you will. The helmet pictured is black and has no vents. It will be hot and uncomfortable to wear. The important thing is proper support for the bike and pedal arm while installing the cotter pins. The pins must be hammered in firmly, without transmitting any of the hammer impact to the BB bearings. Destroying the bearings was common. After installing the pins firmly the nut on each should be tightened to hold them firm. For more info, see these links If the seat has the ability to be tiled back then my advice is don't use it. The child's weight is already so far back on the bike that the extra tilt made the bike less stable and caused the front wheel to lift on steep hills. If that happens, of course you will just lean forward. 

Hands on the tops with elbows bent and tucked back beside your body. This can be uncomfortable at first but may grow on you. Your body position is still low. Again, you're not anywhere near you brakes. This is one of the most common questions from people new to racing. I notice user Rider_X has not responded (yet). If he does then it will be well worth reading. There are four things to do the day before. Looking at various online sources, in general the cadence to aim for is at least 70 rpm. This probably higher than you're using; many of us climb at 50 to 60 rpm, which is hard on the knees.
