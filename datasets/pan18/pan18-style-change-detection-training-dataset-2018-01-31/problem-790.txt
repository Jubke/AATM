Quran very much addresses us to seek for the source of our own beliefs, have we got them from a confident source? My own system of beliefs for example was build in my family, in relation with cousins and later friends and then in thinking about our own and other cultures, all the times in past I was trying to make my system of beliefs less self-inconsistent, always modifying it based on different ideas and theories, mine or others', so that such an evolving system can never be claimed to be rigorous based on a solid ground, always one could ask a why so that I will have no answer in return, but then I came across the religion, after God was proved to me both intellectually and through my hearth I read Quran, which was claimed to be God's book, and found it from no one but God, then I had no other accuse not to accept the God's preferentials over mine, after all it is from the one who knows best, in any conflict between His ideas and mine certainly He knows what I don't know, and this is first trusting and then submitting to Allah, and Submission to Allah is the very meaning of Islam: 

Anyway, that was my perspective. 

Playing with wife or watching her photos/movies all are allowed. Imagination about her (either being pure imagination, or being in the form of remembering memorabilia, or seeing her photos/movies/paintings either realistic or caricature or else) is also allowed but as long as you will not become Jonob. However, playing with wife's body has no limit for the husband becoming jonob or not, so you the man can be satisfied with her wife's body even when she is asleep, or busy doing her own works. In a Fatwa even I saw that the man can rub his private limb to the body of his wife until he ejaculates, you may think it is not very different than masturbation but indeed it is, masturbation is forbidden and it is not. 

The point in this Fatwa --in addition to support what is said above-- is that playing with own private limb in the presence or absence of the partner is forbidden unless it is a part of doing the sexual relation with the partner, a prelude for that or something like that with no intention of enjoying his/her own body. 

In my opinion, cloning is not good. It will probably disrupt the balance in nature. Evil people will may make human farms in far future. Rich people will clone healty and beautiful children, so a different kind of the racism and social class differences between people will start to appear. 

In old times, there was no electricity. Illuminating the environment and surroundings was a problem. Without sufficient ambient light, cutting nails, cutting hair, shaving, etc would spread around more dirt. One of the primary sources of what we call "dust" and "dirt" in our homes is nothing but hairs, granulated death skin tissues. So, in order to prevent or reduce undesired dirt at home. In worst case, this dirt may may even get into food and water in dark. People would had done these kind of sensitive body care works in the daylight. This stayed as a rule and reached to today. 

But we can't say that that it is haram, because we don't have proof or enough knowledge to state so. All the current fatwas are jumping to conclusions from ayats that are actually irrelevant of the topic. Cloning will sure may have some good points too; like producing more animals in a state of drought or scarceness. But also, having good points does not guaranty something to be halal - e.g.; alcohol is haram despite having some good points. 

Cloning is new to humans. I will be easier and more common in the future. This is inevitable, it will be a fact of our lives. We feel some great problems in it. We need to be cautious. We don't know what future will give birth to. But, it is best not to make claims like "it is haram" or "it is halal". Allah forbids it:
