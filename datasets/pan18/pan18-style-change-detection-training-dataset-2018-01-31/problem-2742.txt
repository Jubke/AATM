My former Mission President, Joseph Cook–who was actually mentioned in a talk at the most recent General Conference by his brother Quentin–wrote footnotes into is journals, and would reference them while answering any questions we, his missionaries, may have during personal interviews, it was amazing. I only wish I could see Bruce R. McConkie's personal study journals, but I have a feeling that the vast majority of the fruits of his labours are currently published in the standard works as the study helps, everything else is likely contained in his book, "Mormon Doctrine". 

Satan allowed this church to maintain 90% of the truth, but denied them many plain and precious doctrines which are essential for salvation and exaltation. I'm sure you've heard the old adage, "The best lie is 9/10ths truth." Satan was the first to realize this. 

The part I found most interesting was, "The likeness of God is a complete man, being husband and wife." This seems to be inline with Mosiah Hancock's vision, and spirits being created mates. 

Years ago I remember being told that God the Father did not live simply as another man, but that he was in fact the Saviour and Redeemer of his world, much as Christ is the Saviour and Redeemer of ours. He lived a sinless life, like Christ, and suffered for the sins of all his brothers and sisters. 

Eternal marriage is an essential ordinance that must be performed in order to be exalted, a man or a woman must be sealed to their spouse in the temple before they can be permitted into the presence of the Father. There is however an order to which married couples are admitted into the kingdom, the man enters first, and then guides in his wife. This is just the order of things, the man holds the priesthood, so it is natural that he would perform the ordinance for his wife, or if you want to chew on some more meatier doctrines, his wives, but that's probably best saved for a different question.
