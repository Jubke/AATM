The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. Psalm 18:2 NASB 15 Each had seventy helpers Moses (Num.11:16-17) Jesus ( Lk.10:1). In the other gospels, we hear Jesus telling Peter after the miraculous catch of fish that Jesus would make him a fisher of men. Peter was a fisher of fish--Jesus would make him a fisher of men. (Matthew 4:19) There are three key positions in ancient Israel, that of Prophet, Priest, and King. A prophet would hear from God and speak to the people. A priest would hear from the people and intercede for them to God. A king would, of course, rule. 19 Both were God's spokesman to and for the people. Moses (Ex.9:35; Numb.12:2) Jesus (Heb.1:1-3). They Spoke as oracles of God (Moses Deut. 18:18) Jesus (Jn.14:24, 5:24) Finally, the figurative interpretation breaks down. If a days is a billion years, then how did flowers get pollinated when there were no bees in existence for another billion years? Also, if the sixth day is a billion years from Adam, then we have not yet reached the 7th day of God's rest, since we have a genealogy from Adam that is roughly 6,000 years. Fictitious characters do not have genealogies. No one can trace his lineage back to Elmer Fudd or Pecos Bill, yet the Bible details a genealogy from Adam to Jesus Himself. The nature of the clothing provided by God is that they were from the skins of an animal. Although this is not explicitly stated, it seems reasonable to conclude that this was the first substitutionary sacrifice. An animal had to die to provide the animal skins for that clothing. The death of the innocent animal was sufficient to cover the shame of sin, yet it was insufficient to atone for the guilt, since Adam and Eve were still banished from the garden. So, Adam was not naked at that time in a physical sense, but he was still naked (exposed, in a state of shame) in a spiritual sense.
