wadi (liquid discharged after urination, provided it has not come in contact with urine, which can be ensured if istibra was performed) wazi (liquid seen after ejaculation) mazi (moisture discharge by a man during wooing or courtship) semen urine 1, 2 and 3 are deemed pak (clean). 4 and 5 are najs (unclean), the release of which invalidates waddu and anything that comes in contact with it is deemed najs too. 

This might be confusing. To remove that confusion we have Istibra. If one performs Istibra after urination and liquid is discharged thereafter it is deemed clean even if one doubts whether it is urine or urine came in contact with it. 

What is Istibra? Shortest definition could be, "'milking' of the urethra". It ensures that no more urine is left in the urethra. How does one do that: 

It was narrated from Anas that: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "I passed by the grave of Musa, peace be upon him, and he was praying in his grave."(Nasai)

In Modern era there are lots of ways to figure out the timings of prayers unlike earlier era we are not only dependant on shadows and stars,lots of applications in devices ,some softwares ,these could help us in identifying correct prayer timings however if someone is in a situation when he is not aware of the time and he prays just by his own sense visualizing Sun or darkness/brightness and this was not his routine like may be one time or second so Allah Swt is Raheem could be acceptable 

“The Tarawih prayers are an emphasized Sunna, due to the continued practice of the rightly guided Caliphs, for both men and women… It is a communal Sunna (sunna ala ‘l-kifaya), however, [for men] to perform them in congregation according to the sounder opinion. As such, if the [entire] community of the Mosque abandoned the congregation, they would all be sinful, unless if only some members of the community abandoned it [in which case no one will be sinful]. And any prayer for which congregation is prescribed; it is more virtuous to perform that prayer in the Mosque.”

Reference from Ayatullah Sayyid Ali Husaini Sistani: Taharat » Istibra 

I have to say the details of deeming a person Kathirush shak wasn't easy to understand (p.418) and not easy to explain. But, if you doubt at least in every third prayer for more than three times then you can deem yourself as Kathirush shak. 

What is Istibra? Shortest definition could be, "'milking' of the urethra". It ensures that no more urine is left in the urethra. How does one do that: 

It is the liquid that, at times, comes out after urination. If it doesn't come in contact with urine it is clean. 

If one doesn't perform Istibra, and liquid is discharged it is deemed unclean. If one doubts whether he did it properly or not, it is deemed clean. And if one, doubts whether he did it or not it is deemed unclean.
