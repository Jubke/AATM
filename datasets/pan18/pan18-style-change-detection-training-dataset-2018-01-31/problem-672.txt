Expected Profits in case of win = 400 + 60 + 60 - 60 = 460 Explanation as to why approaches give the same answer: Prob of no aces 48/52 * 47/51 * ..... * 37/41 = 0.3376 = 33.8% The calculations given in your example make sense. Except you write 53/44 when you should have written 35/44 I believe. In the case that player A checks, the expectation value of profit will be: <(A)> = Expected Income - bet = (35/44)*(400 + 60 + 60) - 60 = 353. Scenario 1. Suppose you call and your opponent after the turn card (which doesn't make your flush) bets 200. The pot size is now 1000 and it costs 200 to call. With odds of 1:5 and a 20% chance of hitting the flush on the river it makes sense to call. The size of the pot required to justify chasing a flush after the flop depends on how likely your opponent is to let you see both the turn and the river. If you are against a new opponent and you do not know whether the opponent likes to bet big on the turn or just call or min bet, what pot size do you really need in order to chase your flush? Expected Profits in case of loss = - 60 Similarly, for 3 Aces, we find the probability to be, <(A)> = (35/44)*(400 + 60 + 60) - 60 Therefore the probability of at least one ace being dealt is given by 1 - 0.3376 = 0.6624 = 66.24% Finally the probability that all 4 aces are dealt is given by, The accuracy of these number can be verified, by adding them together to give 66.24% - the answer to the first part of the question above. 12C3 * (48P9)/(52P12) = 0.0325 = 3.25% 12C4 * (48P8)/(52P12) = 0.001828 = 0.182% 12 * 4/52 * 48/51 * 47/50 * ... * 38/41 = 0.4379 = 43.79% In this scenario, your initial call of 200 after the flop had a positive EV. The probability of 2 and only 2 Aces being dealt is given by:
