Turn Villain could have made the flush or still called with a Q. 

There are testing agencies like ecorgra that sites may submit to. Since you are deep BTN could call with any pair, suited connector, and maybe any two cards T+. 

That is at best a marginal hand in that position. Let's say you are playing it to hope for flush or straight. In that case you want multiple players in the pot as if you hit your flush or straight then 99% of the time you have the winning hand. You don't need to raise to build the pot as you already have a raise in front of you. Just calling is building a decent size pot. In early position you also extract less from other players when you do hit. 

In summary why in the world you you call that all in bet? 

Your distinction of honesty of the implementation vs a weak random algorithm is mute. As an external observer all you know is what came out. Unless they disclose the implementation. Federal law is probably going to need to play out in courts. Again IANAL (I am not a lawyer). 

You are not trying to get them all in pre-flop unless they are very short stacked. They will just just fold marginal hands and only call you with premium. The power of the big stack is more fold equity as post flop you can easily put them all in. In a spot where you might only call you should raise. You don't need to over bet - a decent raise is scary to them. Flop You bet the pot so villain was not getting direct odds to call a draw. TT is usually going to hold up here. A Q would call here that you are ahead of. I don't know how many or increments but if you start at $15 and doubled each tournament you could play 6 tournaments. That is two more than if you just play 4 @ $250.
