You are 17 years old. In a year you'll have your majority. You already have a job as a programmer at the Fraunhofer institut, which is known for it's quality work in computer science. You're also an excellent student and you play the guitar well enough to win various prices. This is most likely impossible to achieve. Facebook (and the other social networks your daughter wants to use) themselves would need to provide you with this ability, and AFAIK, they don't. Third-party software would need to be incredibly sophisticated to provide you with what you want, which is probably the reason why you haven't found any. Once she understands what is okay and what isn't, and understands that she is responsible for her behavior towards others, you'll need to define consequences of what happens when she missteps again, and then trust her to behave. If she doesn't, you'll need to follow through with the consequences you defined. I'm not quite sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. In this answer, I'm assuming that your son takes nude pictures of himself (because of points 2 and 7 on your list) and sends them to friends (if he sends them to random strangers, immediately stop this, if necessary by removing his ability to take nude pictures of himself, in order to protect your child!). I think you have to be 100% honest. Talking it out during therapy is a good idea. Set rules and follow them. There are set consequences for breaking the rules. Perhaps the therapist can help you decide on appropriate rules/goals and consequences. My 16 year old wants to give her teachers Christmas gifts. She is in 10th grade, so there are quite a number of teachers. I think that your daughter should not be chatting on the net in private -- and that doesn't mean she can't have privacy, but that she is in a common area while she plays or chats. I think secrecy was a holdover from my parent's generation. My own mum could not discuss birth control with me the week before my wedding! I simply asked what she used, not about sex and she said to talk to my doctor. She was born in the 1920s and I gather times were different! I hope you know that it is perfectly okay for you to say 'no' while she is 17. Same as she gets to make adult choices when she is one. It is also perfectly okay for you not to pay for this trip. Adults do not ask Mum and Dad for help doing things when Mum and Dad don't like the plan. It's your daughter who has to decide whether she feels uncomfortable, and whether to address that feeling by confronting the boys in question. It won't do her any good if you solve problems for her that she needs to learn to handle herself. I think the way forward shouldn't be to "take away the internet" - you can't possibly do this. He can get on a friend's wifi hotspot, on free wifi hotspots, can use the internet at school etc. So this is just a punishmet that won't cure the problem (to keep him from taking nude pictures of himself, you'd have to remove his access to a camera - e.g. take away his phone - this wouldn't be foolproof either, but much more effective). Give her feedback on her social media use What you can do for starters is to tell her that you want to see what she's doing on her social media accounts, and that this is the condition for her getting internet access at home. Then take some time now and then to let her show you what she's posting on Facebook and other social media accounts (Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp have mostly replaced Facebook for teens, btw) and discuss it with her. Favor education over control You need to approach this problem not with a technical solution, which is ultimately guaranteed to fail, but with education, followed by trust. Once she understands what is okay and what isn't, and understands that she is responsible for her behavior towards others, you'll need to define consequences of what happens when she missteps again, and then trust her to behave. If she doesn't, you'll need to follow through with the consequences you defined. If Dad is in the loop, please make him a part of it. No one (including parents) can back down or change the rules. I have a niece who was informed by the RCMP that she had been chatting with an older man who was not another pre-teen, but an officer looking for predators. Her parents had quite the wake up call. You have to parent and that means you need passwords and access. My 16 year old wants to give her teachers Christmas gifts. She is in 10th grade, so there are quite a number of teachers. I think you have to be 100% honest. Talking it out during therapy is a good idea. Set rules and follow them. There are set consequences for breaking the rules. Perhaps the therapist can help you decide on appropriate rules/goals and consequences. It is a difficult balance and in our home, I am not always liked for my approach. Her father is just as strict, thank goodness because I of course cannot control what happens at his house beyond normal parent/child stuff. I have to trust him and I do.
