I would like to talk more about the adjustment I made when playing Rush poker(fulltilt)/ Zoom (poker stars). In cash games, the usual rake is 5% of the pot (every hand) up to a limit of ~3$-5$ (depends on the site). If the flop is not dealt, there is no rake. Its like insurance plans - each site change their rules slightly, so it will be difficult to compare between them. The sites usually give a "discount" if you join an expensive tournaments. For example, 100$ buy in tournaments has 8$-9$ rake. In cash games, the rake limitation is a build-in discount for players playing big cash games. For example, 0.5$/1$ blinds, 6 players table. lets assume that average pot is 20$ (just a number) --> In this case the rake will be 1$ (5%). In 25$/50$ blinds, the average pot is 400$ (again, just a number) --> the rake is 3$ (according to rake limitation) which is >1% rake. sometimes the sites "punish" players playing small tournaments by slightly increasing rakes (1$+0.12$). When a site want to promote a specific game/cash level/tournament etc. it might temporarily reduce the rake a little bit. There are more issues that indirectly might influence rake like promotions and frequent player points, but this is subject to a different question If we reach the river unimproved, I give up in almost all situations, the exceptions being if we have extraordinary reason to believe he will call through to the river and then give up OR if I feel a need to demonstrate my ability to bluff big to establish a specific image. Toby's answer of Pokerstars.com is a good option if you are outside of the United States. If you are in the US, you can't currently play real money games on Pokerstars for reasons similar to the reasons that FullTilt was shut down. You can still play most free/play-money games there. But should you desire to move to real money play, it is not an option. Additionally, you cannot play in freeroll tournaments. 

In the ~180 hands played, what has Villain seen of us? That's enough time for a reg at these stakes online to have his own reads/stats on us, and for him to react to it. Knowing what he has seen of us in order to factor in how he might adjust his play specifically against us seems worth consideration. Also, do we have any stats on his 3bet %, his fold to 3bet %, or his street-by-street AF? There would be a lot of error in those stats with such a small sample, but they could come in handy. 

Other good options for players in the US include Lock Poker and Black Chip Poker. Both of these sites offer play money games, AND they allow you to play in freerolls or to move to real money games if you ever decide that you would like to do so. Based on that, I do not think that QQ+ is in his range, and I think JJ is in it, but is fairly unlikely (perhaps 50/50 on whether he would call or 4bet pre). Similarly, I think he folds AJ more often than he calls, and he almost never has another Jx/8x hand (as he would fold these preflop when OOP and facing a 3bet). 88 and 44 are both easily in his range, but no more so than each of the other small/medium pairs. Further, I believe that this is the majority of his range: hands that are fairly easy to play OOP, thus justifying him to stay around preflop.
