Are "Thought" Verbs a sign of weak writing? Or just an stylistic choice? 

I'm not sure if these are the best ways of accomplishing what I want. Any suggestions? (other than looking for a native speaker to correct my work)? 

"I see," Erin said, half-smiling. 

"But then how can you, like, be alive without a soul?" 

Each part of the dialogue reveals something about the characters. But I feel the first part is very dull (I guess the second part is more exciting). And the third part is the "climax" of the dialogue. 

So my advice is that: try to find an idea that you truly love. 

Okay, some practical advice: watch George Carlin, Bill Hicks, or Louis CK's clips on YouTube. 

I've realized that I always start sentences with (name of character), he, she, it, they, her, his, the, after (a moment/that), and then. I wonder if there's any useful exercise or tip to reduce this? 

Is it usually better to not to mix dialogue and action tags in the same "dialogue unit?" If not, what are the situations you would like to do so? 

"She's just talkative, that's all. Besides, she's new. She just want to learn as much as she can." 

I started looking at each character as a "short story." This is truth for any novel; every character produces a subplot which is somehow connected with the main one. 

As for the writing...okay maybe this one is more important. However, the term is a little ambiguous. What do you mean by writing? The quality of the prose? Whether it's funny? 

I want to add a few chapters that don't push the story forward; they only explore the background and motivations of the characters. 

The test of time: Keep the story in your head for a couple of weeks. Does it come back to you when you're not thinking about it? Is it becoming more and more appealing over time instead of losing its charm? If the answer is yes, move on to the next step.
