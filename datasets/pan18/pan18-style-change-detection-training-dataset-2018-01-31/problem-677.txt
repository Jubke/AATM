For speed could stop calculating a hand when you know it is dead. But that would be a lot more logic and I wanted the detail on all hands. Flop a royal in hole'em = 1 / 649,740 QQ AA is 2.21627112383415E-005 Playing out of position on the river and missed your hand. Have played in a manner that you can represent a good hand. You are considering bluffing. On a table of 6 if 4 fold you have one opponent. The easy case is bet the pot. You need a fold 1/2 the time. You risk 1 to win 2 (pot, your bet, opponent fold). This includes 4 and 5 on the board so another player with with a single flush could win. Correct no one is likely to fold JJ+ or a big suited ace. This is called card removal. Address this statistically is complex and for the most part you just play poker. Which cards have the best chance of making a straight? 2 flush combin(11, 2) = 55 other cards = 39 55 * 39 / 19600 = 0.1094387755 = 11% = 1 / 9 Even on line many sites restrict the levels of calculators. 4 hands is not twice as long as 2 as same number of shuffles. And you get better accuracy for the same number of shuffles as there are less possible boards. Royal hole card draw chance = 8% (higher than I thought it would be) You make a flush on the river with 89s only 3 on the board - what is the chance you opponent has an over flush? If they play any two flush then like 2.0% but they are not likely to play like QJT little or under T and not connected so like 1.5%. Someone is not likely to bet with a random hand. You get to the river and you have nothing but a bluff catcher. Bottom pair on a scary board. If they made their hand they have they have you beat. But you can beat on outright bluff. 3 flush combin(11, 3) = 165 / 19600 = 0.0084183673 = 0.84% = 1/119 First you need the two royal cards in your hole cards. You don't want a 3rd as it blocks the royal. 77, 88, 99, 78, 79, 89 also has you beat At the table it does not matter if you are 85% or 81%. If think you are ahead then you play the hand. 9T is better than 89 as the T blocks the ace high straight The answer from TmKVU of 1 - (48/50)^14 is wrong in my opinion At 48 cards 1-(48/50)^48 does not approach zero - it is 85.9% This is for just 3 players on the table The online calculators that are instantaneous I guess process all combinations at like 20 million shuffles each and store that. I am not really sure how they do it. You can get that same number with further break down on all hands when it wins / ties did it do so as what hand (straight flush down to high card) (my app does not currently do that - going to add it) 9 diamonds flush (5 straight flush) 0 fives 3 sevens counterfeit 3 eights top pair 3 nines top pair 3 tens straight 2 jacks counterfeit This took me about 20 hours but I am a developer I moved to a new version of .NET and Visual Studio and wanted a project to practice with
