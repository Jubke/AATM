Zakat is calculated by taking 2.5% of your net wealth that has remained in your possession for a whole lunar year. 

He said: If they are married away by the father or the grandfather, that is, the minor boy and the minor girl, they have no option, after they attain puberty. The reason is that these two (relatives) possess an informed opinion and abundant affection, therefore, the contract will become binding if it is concluded by them. It is just as if it was concluded with their consent after they had attained puberty. 

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A matron should not be given in marriage except after consulting her; and a virgin should not be given in marriage except after her permission." The people asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! How can we know her permission?" He said, "Her silence (indicates her permission). [Saheeh Muslim] 

The Hanafi view as mentioned in Hidayah (arabic, english): 

Fourth: Adornments are of two types, the created ones and the acquired ones. The created ones include the face, it is the origin of adornment and beauty ... the acquired ones are those the women use to improve their appearance such as clothes, ornaments, kohl and cosmetics. Allah has said: "Take your adornments"[Quran 7:31] 

While often used as a form of long-term Islamic financing, murabaha can just as easily be used in a more immediate sense (e.g. having someone acquire a particular product for you if you can't leave the house). The "services provided" — be they for the long-term or the immediate transaction — would be the willingness and ability of the third party (e.g. the bank) to serve as an intermediary. 

Murabaha is, in its essence, just a pair of shari'ah-compliant trades: 

What is important to note is that the first trade needs to be completed in full: The involved good is fully and completely owned by the bank after they purchase it before it can then be resold to the end buyer. Until such time as the final sale is transacted with the end buyer, the bank legally owns the property (and is responsible for any risks and/or costs that may entail). 

Adding a profit when reselling a good is rather fundamental to trade, and can hardly be considered riba; God has clearly permitted one and forbidden the other. The only difference between a regular trade and a murabaha agreement is that the end buyer and price profit margin are agreed to in advance. 

Narrated Khansa bint Khidam Al-Ansariya: that her father gave her in marriage when she was a matron and she disliked that marriage. So she went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he declared that marriage invalid. [Saheeh Bukhari] 

Majority opinion is that it is permissible to marry the person with whom one has committed Zina, provided that the person is not a habitually unchaste person and that they both sincerely repent of their sin and that a period equal to iddah has passed since the unlawful intercourse.

One saying is that: Now all women, free and slaves are obligated to observe the hijab. This is similar to how the Sahabah prevented the Muslim women from visiting the mosques after the death of the Prophet (p.b.u.h), whereas the Prophet had said: "Do not prevent the women servants of Allah from the Mosques"(Bukhari), in so far that Ayesha said: "If the Prophet was alive in our time he would have also prevented the women from visiting the mosques, just like how the women of the Jews (Israelites) do not visit the mosques (synagogues)".

Is this provided service worth the profit margin involved? That's up to the end buyer (and basic supply and demand) to decide.
