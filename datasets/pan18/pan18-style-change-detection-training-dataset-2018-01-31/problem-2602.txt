(6) [No one] attended the meeting yesterday [but John] Since the subject is closer to interrogative C than the object, it counts as an intervener to wh-movement of the object, as attested by the ungrammaticality of (b). This is a great question! I personally don't know of any NLs which mark the distinction morphologically, and i'd be very surprised indeed to find one that did. Suppose in a hypothetical language L, an anaphoric pronoun is assigned form A, and a cataphoric one is assigned form B. The distribution of A and B would have to conditioned by the linear order of A/B with respect to its antecedent, which may be at a potentially unbounded distance away. Syntactic/morphological rules just don't work that way - syntactic rules don't tend to invoke linear order at all, and morphological rules only invoke linear order to the extent that forms can be conditioned by adjacent material.

I've only included featural specifications (which are given in square brackets) where they will be relevant to the derivation. Note that i'm also going to ignore subject-auxiliary inversion in the derivation. I also use bare phrase structure labelling, so no distinction between maximal projections and intermediate levels. Note that the exceptive phrase can't appear between the verb and it's object. It can appear here, however, if we just make the object a little heavier, licensing heavy NP shift: (5) ? [No one] attended [but John] [the meeting we all said we would go to] This grammar works crucially by defining the copying rule S[x] -> T[x]T[x]. This rewrite rule takes the stack of symbols on S, and duplicates the stack on two new non-terminals, which exist only to hold the duplicated stacks (they are ultimately deleted via T[] -> E). Once the stacks have been duplicated, the non-terminals in the stacks are 'popped off' one by one to generate strings of terminals. Because the stacks have previously been duplicated, the strings resulting from popping off non-terminals from the stacks of T are guaranteed to be identical. (15) ??

[no one] attended the meeting [but for John] Going through the derivation might help. Since your question is framed in terms of the generative framework, i'll give my answer also from a generative PoV - specifically, from the PoV of the Minimalist Program, where movement is feature-driven. I presuppose i certain amount of familiarity with minimalism in my answer, so apologies in advance. Al watched TV a lot last night. In brief, whether speech error data is relevant to the question of derivational order in syntax depends on just how much explanation syntactic theory owes to a theory of linguistic performance. Entailment from the progressive to the perfect: Al gave Mary a ring in a year. Al is giving Mary a ring. !=> Al has given Mary a ring. By not displaying inverse scope, I mean that an equivalent translation of (1) would support the interpretation in (2) but not in (3). Perhaps the same for (4) with the interpretations paraphrased in (5) and (6): Single-event compatibility with "in"-phrases: Al is watching TV. => Al has watched TV. *Al gave Mary a ring a lot last night. *Al gave Mary a ring for a year. Some student saw every professor There is a (single) student (say, John) such that he saw every professor For every professor x, there is a (different) student that saw x There is a solution to every problem There is a (single) solution such that it applies to every problem For every problem x, there is a (different) solution for x I am wondering if there are any verbs/phrases that qualify both as ditransitive, and as atelic. The following shows the relevant tests. The satisfying verb/phrase should have the same * patterns as give w.r.t. ditransitivity, but * patterns with sleep and watch in the telicity tests. A complete answer will provide the evidence that the proposed word passes the test in these ways. Alright, Greg hit the button before me. But, case is a morphological modification of a word -- not necessarily a suffix, so it could be a prefix, infix, or "mutation". A candidate for independent post-nominal word exists Logoori. There is a lexeme -éné which appears towards the right edge of the NP, which can be preceded by any part of speech (not just nouns), which seems to signal definiteness, and passes certain tests of word-hood. Some examples are: With this background: in what languages is case assigned to elliptical NP answers in the same way as it is to NPs integrated into a full S; in what case languages are elliptical answers given some default case form; and in what languages do you get both patterns, depending on some other factor? Somewhat finally, your concept of "explanation" needs to be clarified. The notion of "explanation" is notoriously elusive yet often-invoked in science. There is an equation in theoretical physics E=hf which states that the energy of a photon is the product of its frequency and Planck's constant. This does not explain why this particular thing should be the rule. I could assume that you are referring to Chomsky's third desideratum of theory (from Current issues in linguistic theory), namely "explanatory adequacy". This principle basically says that an explanatory metatheory allows a single grammar that generates a particular language. Explanatory adequacy can only be a requirement of a metatheory of language, not the syntax of a specific language. Since you are just asking for a grammar of English, then it is meaningless to require explanatory adequacy. And therefore, you must have in mind something completely different when you invoke the desideratum of explanation.
