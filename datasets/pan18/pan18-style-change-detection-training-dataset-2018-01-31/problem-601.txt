Hero (SB): $1980 BB: $2826 UTG: $1176 MP: $837 CO: $1240 BTN: $1177 Turn: ($139, 2 players) Q♥ Hero bets $105, CO calls $105 I'd get into a range analysis but the info isn't readily apparent from the hand history, so as it is I'd check-call most streets with the intention of getting it All-In at some point, generally the river, but only against the worse opponent. Otherwise I'm inclined to be very cautious. SB posts SB 0.5 BB, BB posts BB 1 BB River: ($315) A⋄ MP bets $248, Hero? Turn: (14.3BB, 2 players) A♥ BB bets 5 BB, Hero calls 5 BB Opponent is a smart semi-tight player, a TAG with tricks. 27/22/2.8 (VPIP/PFR/AF) over ~980 hands. I've been playing a similar yet slightly tighter style than him. Assuming you don't get any heavy action from villain #2, and the board runs out low and non coordinated, check calling is about all you can do, or you'l likely overplay your hand. If villain keeps betting half pot all the way through the turn, he'll have very close to a pot sized bet at the river. If you can assume he'll do this and you're willing to take this one-pair, good kicker hand to showdown, check-calling the flop and turn, and check-shoving the river seems a viable line to have the spewtard barrel off a bluff. Shoving is far less desirable if villain #2 is still in the hand of course. Ultimately though, your play makes your hand look very weak. Since you have under-represented your hand through the small bet on the flop and just calling the tiny turn, you can't give up on the river without more information on this villain. Based on that, I do not think that QQ+ is in his range, and I think JJ is in it, but is fairly unlikely (perhaps 50/50 on whether he would call or 4bet pre). Similarly, I think he folds AJ more often than he calls, and he almost never has another Jx/8x hand (as he would fold these preflop when OOP and facing a 3bet). 88 and 44 are both easily in his range, but no more so than each of the other small/medium pairs. Further, I believe that this is the majority of his range: hands that are fairly easy to play OOP, thus justifying him to stay around preflop. In limit games, the only raise amount allowed is the big blind during preflop and flop play; double the big blind during turn and river play. Second, let's look at history: You noted in the comments that Villian has not let a pot check around. Also, he way overplayed a couple of face cards, a low pair, or worse in the TT hand. Finally, his play feels as though he is trying to act strong, which fits the classic "act strong when weak" tell. The correct minimum raise in big bet games (no limit and pot limit) is to increase the amount of the bet by the amount of the previous bet (e.g. double the previous raise*), or to raise all-in if you do not have enough in your stack to actually double the previous raise. Reference: http://www.learn-texas-holdem.com/how-large-is-the-minimum-raise.htm Honestly, I prefer either a larger bet to maintain control of the hand, or a similar bet to the one you made, with the intent of 3-bet shoving. You're a coinflip with almost any legit hand in the villain's range (the hands that have you crushed are AA/KK/3x and all are fairly unlikely, both from the perspective of combinatorics and from the perspective of likelihood that a villain gets to the flop with them in this line). You gain value in the dead money when many of the hands you are flipping with fold to a flop 3-bet, and it more than offsets the loss for the times you are beat. $6 NL (6 max) - Holdem - 6 players Villain's a good player so I know his pre-flop range is very wide here. Thus, I can assume that I'll often flop good equity with this hand and It's likely I have card-advantage in this situation vs this opponent. Generally, as we are deep there is a fair amount of room for manoeuvre here.
