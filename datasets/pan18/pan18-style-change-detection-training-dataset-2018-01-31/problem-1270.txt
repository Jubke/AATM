At the heart of it, it is an inaccurate statement that presupposes all white people are wealthy. This ignores the multitude of white individuals that are poor. 

The Background Check that is usually performed for those granted access to classified material is replaced by candidacy and election process for the President. 

Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2 doesn't require it. What about industrial hemp? Does this create a new market for hemp products? No. The law is focused on legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. The law modifies the definition of “marijuana” to include only cannabis greater than 0.3 percent THC concentration. Cannabis under this limit – industrial hemp – is not treated as recreational “marijuana.” Putting aside a violent overthrow of the government, since the impacts of such an event would go well beyond installing a simple theocracy, focus on the other two. They are inextricably linked, given the full weight of the requirements to amend the Constitution in accordance with Article V. 3/4 of the States would have to ratify any amendment. That means 3/4ths of the state legislatures would also need to be in [group] control. How large do you think [group] is, as a proportion of the populace? 

No, Bill Clinton does not have the Need to Know to be granted access to Top Secret information. 

This was amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, of OCT 2001. This definition, established by Congress via their legislative authorities, is the foundation for the Federal Definition of domestic terrorism. The Code of Federal Regulations are merely the general and permanent regulations published by executive department and agencies of the Federal Government. This rule making is empowered by "enabling legislation" following acts passed by Congress. In a rule fight between the United States Code and the Code of Federal Regulations, the USC wins. Federal land: Marijuana is still illegal on federal land, including national parks, ski slopes and military bases. The free market made the Internet what it is today. Attempts to monopolize and control it aren't new, but they have thus far failed to do so. If they ever do succeed, then we can talk about Net Neutrality. But for now, the term "Net Neutrality" is just a pleasant-sounding euphemism for "Government regulation of the Internet". And the Internet and all of the players on it large and small have shown us, consistently, time and time again, that there is little need of the government's "protection". 

Constitutionally speaking, the President only has as much influence over the budget as any other congressional bill. Practically speaking, however, the President wields a lot of power over taxpayer funds. Even though it's Congress's job to pass budget bills, it's the President's job to actually spend that money. And that's where things get interesting. 

It is important to remember North Korea's attitude as well. Officially, the Korean War in the 1950's never ended. What the world has been living with is actually a 60-year ceasefire. North Korea and the United States are still technically at war with each other. 

All the FCC did was repeal a rule it made in 2015. That's it. The Internet is now and has always been the free and open platform we know despite an almost complete vacuum of government regulations of any kind. For the past three decades it has plodded along, doing its thing, and changing the world -- curiously absent of the corporatist apocalypse that Net Neutrality's proponents have been warning us about for years. The answer to your question is all around you. But the tax credits appear to help wealthier people more than low-income individuals. 

There is the possibility that there could be a wider range of plans, but those plans will be written by the insurance companies and could have high deductibles or a narrow network range. States are likely to have a big say in exactly which plans they choose to offer, according to the AP. At least 480,000 people overstayed their visas last year, adding to a backlog that’s reached some 5 million total, members of Congress said. But immigration agents launched investigations into just 10,000 of them, or about 0.2 percent, and arrested fewer than 2,000, less than 0.04 percent, saying the others don’t rise to the level of being priority targets. Not to mention that there are also dozens of tunnels that have yet to be discovered. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center noted at least 10 taxes written into Obamacare that would be repealed or delayed under the new plan, including the “Cadillac” tax that is set to kick in in 2020 but would be delayed until 2025 under the new plan. 

But the Congressional Budget Office has yet to release its estimates of what the new plan would cost people or how many people would possibly lose coverage. 

Craig Healy, assistant director for national security investigations at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said as he struggled to defend the administration’s meager efforts. 

What happens if you don’t sign up? While people who did not sign up for insurance either through their employer, a private plan or the ACA were subject to fines, the new bill also contains a “mandate” of sorts. 

Prior to 1974, there was no formal budget process, and no clear requirement that the President spend money the way Congress had actually allocated it. The President could flat-out refuse to spend money at all (known as Impoundment), and there was little Congress could do to force him. That all changed with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, which formalized the budget process and limited the President's impoundment powers (Nixon was in office and was embroiled in the Watergate scandal at the time, so he didn't have the political capital to resist the bill's passage). The law requires the President to submit a budget to Congress every year, so he still has a fair voice in budgetary matters, but his budget is just a proposal. Constitutionally speaking, the President only has as much influence over the budget as any other congressional bill. Practically speaking, however, the President wields a lot of power over taxpayer funds. Even though it's Congress's job to pass budget bills, it's the President's job to actually spend that money.
