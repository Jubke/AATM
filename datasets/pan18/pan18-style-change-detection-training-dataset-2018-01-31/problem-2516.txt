(Masked Syllable Priming Effects in Word and Picture Naming in Chinese, by Wenping You, Qingfang Zhang, Rinus G. Verdonschot) For a Japanese speaker, it would probably be difficult to hear the difference between Czech syllable pairs like "dý" vs. "dí", or "dí" vs. "ží" vs. ""zí". I found this exception mentioned in the fourth edition of John Walker's "Critical Pronouncing Dictionary" (1846), but there is no explanation given. The Oxford English Dictionary entries for these three words also don't explain the pronunciation. Is Chomsky and Halle's viewpoint current in phonology, or do most people now have a different interpretation? I know there are other approaches to phonology, such as Optimality Theory, but I am only an amateur and not familar with them in any depth. Mandarin Retroflex Suffixation: An OT Account, by Ma Qiuwu 

For Spanish, the phoneme /ʝ/ often sounds similar to English /dʒ/. Wikipedia's article on Spanish phonology says that in standard Castillian, this phoneme is realized as an affricate [ɟʝ] after a pause or after a nasal or lateral consonant. This is very similar phonetically to [dʒ], and I believe some Spanish dialects do just use [dʒ] (in others, [dʒ] has been changed by lenition to [ʒ], which may then be devoiced to [ʃ]). 

Also, we see /s/ in -ance/-ence words, where there is no (at least, no overt) following segment corresponding to /j/. I am trying to understand the following passages from The Sound Pattern of English, by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle. 

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to access this book yet, but I may be able to request it from my library. It seems in addition to the retroflex suffix, it also discusses reduplication. Stress & vowel length The main motivation that I think I understand is stress and vowel length: if we say that "potency" has only two syllables at the level of phonology where stress and vowel length rules are applied, this explains why it doesn't show "trisyllabic laxing"/"Luick's law" and has a long rather than a short vowel in the initial syllable. Likewise, the stress of "presidency" can be analyzed as antepenult rather than pre-antepenult. However, this seems kind of a lame motivating factor in itself considering that there are many other extra-metrical suffixes in English that aren't, as far as I know, analyzed as lacking syllabic nuclei, such as -ness, -less. Also, I know of at least one exception to the apparent extrametricality of -y in -ency/-ancy nouns: the word discrepancy, which is typically pronounced with antepenult stress on the e, which is "short". It seem to me that it would be bizarre to explain this by saying that "potency" ends in /j/ but "discrepancy" ends in /i/.
