Not really useful you now, but important later on - remember to show your child that the Frida is a good thing. The feeling is not pleasent and your baby will not like it. Funny faces, sounds, sucking wife/husband's nose with it may make your baby less fearful. My daughter enjoyed me raising the frida and doing an elephant sound. We've also always showed her what we sucked from her nose, so that she knew what we were doing and why. And we told her to breathe through her nose immediately after, so that she noticed it's cleaner and easier to breathe. 

When will the baby stop feeling pain during bowel movements and passing gas? What are your experiences? When did your children stop fussing/crying because of that? 

Our daughter is 2 months old. As of right now, we have a pretty well working routine of putting the baby to sleep. Bath, lights out, long feeding, then falling asleep on our hands, then falling asleep on us when we sit/lay, then being put to bed. It all takes about 2 hours, which is acceptable. 

Today our two week old was (and still is) unusually agitated. She slept two hours less than her up-until-now average, requested breastfeeding for entire one hour more and was more cry-prone than ever. She has trouble going to sleep, won't sleep on her own, has to either fall asleep on a breast or be cuddled. And when she does sleep, she won't sleep for too long and will soon wake up crying, instead of usual calm looking around or fussing. And she rejects a dummy which she liked before. 

For sleeping in his crib, that's going to take time and patience. The swaddling might help, and having a routine will DEFINITELY help (turn on the white noise, rock and feed, place him on his back and gently rub his chest for a few minutes, things like that; do these things every single time you put him down, so that he knows what to expect and will be less anxious trying to anticipate what will happen next). 

Oh! Just remembered the Five S's! We used these to great effect with both ours (swaddle, swing, side (not while sleeping!), shush, suckle). Heck, my older child is nearly 7 and when she's had a really bad day, I still use some of those to help her calm down. 

Our elder child didn't sleep until she was two, so we tried LOTS of things to help her sleep. One that was a huge help was suggested by our pediatrician, which is the 90-minute activity cycle. Essentially, after waking, a child will be active and hungry for approximately 90 minutes, and then be ready for another sleep, and will nap for 90 minutes or a multiple thereof, at which point they awaken and you lather-rinse-repeat. Watch his activity for a few days; if you see that he starts getting tired and cranky about 90 minutes after waking, go ahead & put him down for a nap and see if it helps.

To sum up, it seems I shouldn't have worried. 

Another thing to remember is to keep your home humid - or at least the room where the baby sleeps. If you have very low humidity, the nose will get stuffed and the baby's breathind comfort will decrease. 

My wife, almost two weeks after a C-section, is able to do practically all work related to baby care. Only baths are left to me, and even then she does assist me. I'd like to think we do 50% of the work, but actually she probably does more. I am currently on a leave and soon I will go to work - and during the day she will have to take care of our baby on her own. 

My daughter seems to have calmed down. She does not seem to have grown yet, but she does seem "smarter" and more agile. She rotates her head more quickly, follows our faces with her eyes more "fluently" (she used to do it, but in large "jumps"). She also spends more time just lying and looking around at the world. I guess she gathered enough experience points and was going through a level-up;)

@Stephie nailed it, but I'll add a couple more suggestions. If you don't currently swaddle your son, try it. In the last trimester, babies are crammed quite tightly in the uterus, and tend to find being swaddled snugly to be comforting. We swaddled both of ours as long as we could do so safely.
