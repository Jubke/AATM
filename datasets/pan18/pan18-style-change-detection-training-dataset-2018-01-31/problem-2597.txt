Also, having a reflexive in object position doesn't give rise to a principle C violation with a co-referring proper name in the exceptive phrase, so we know that the exceptive phrase isn't c-commanded by the object: Where: x denotes an arbitrary collection of stack symbols, S is the sentence symbol, T, f, g and h are non-terminals, a,b and c are terminals, and E is the empty string. 

Despite not being so hot when it comes to formal language theory, i decided to take a stab at an answer after all (using this as a reference). Here is the grammar for the language L = {ww ∣ w ∈ {a,b,c} ∗ }, which consists of a set of rewrite rules: Unfortunately it's much harder to prove a negative than a positive, but since i'm feeling brazen i'm going to go ahead and answer this question by saying that such a natural language couldn't exist. Now someone go ahead and try to disprove me. (13) [but for John] [No one] attended the meeting. (14) [Except for John] [no one] attended the meeting. (1) [No one] [but John] attended the meeting (2) [No one] attended the meeting [but John] (3) * [No one] attended [but John] the meeting (4) * [but John] [no one] attended the meeting 

Movement of the subject 'you' to SpecIP is triggered (by, e.g. an EPP feature on I): We can tell that [no one] is sitting fairly high when it appears discontinuous from the subject because we can have intervening adverbials: First we merge 'whom' and 'invite', so that 'invite' satisfies its internal theta-role, and 'whom' is assigned accusative case. Note that 'whom' possesses an interpretable Wh feature. 

I'm not sure it's worth seriously addressing your contention that languages without m-case are inferior with regards to poetry, but i'll just add that Shakespeare, Milton, Donne, Keats, Wordsworth etc. would beg to differ... except-exceptives seem much more free to modify non-quantificational DPs. Curiouser and curiouser. It's worth comparing the distribution of [but X] with [except X], since both seem to have a very similar function: 

I don't have an analysis (and hence, no answer) yet, but i thought it would be interesting to leave these facts here as a work in progress. Tentatively, it looks like the exceptive phrase can be stranded in the VP-internal subject position by A-movement of the subject to the matrix subject position, hence the possibility of the discontinuous order. I'll be coming back to this when i have some more time. 

So it looks like, more or less, [except X] and [but X] have an identical distribution. One interesting thing to note is that sentence-initial exceptive phrases can be repaired by inserting for: 

(9) [No one] [except John] attended the meeting. (10) [No one] attended the meeting [except John] (11) * [No one] attended [except John] the meeting (12) ??? [except John] [no one] attended the meeting ((12) only grammatical with prosodic break between exceptive phrase and subject) One thing to note as a preliminary is that [but John], which i'll tentatively call the exceptive phrase, can appear discontinuous from the NP no one which it seems to modify, although it's fairly restricted in where it can appear. 

From the data above, it looks like but-exceptives can only modify something quantificational, but it only plays nicely with certain quantifiers (presumably this is a fact that can be derived from the semantics of the exceptive phrase). Additionally, it doesn't seem to play nicely with an overt distributive marker each, which i find odd. except-exceptives stand in stark contrast: but-exceptives are restricted in the sorts of phrases they can modify: Now we've reached the crucial part of the derivation. Interogative C possesses an uninterpretable wh-feature, which must be deleted before spell-out, or the derivation will crash. The [*u*Wh] feature 'probes' downwards for a matching 'goal' - since 'whom' posseses an interpretable [wh] it counts as a matching goal. Once the goal is found, movement of 'whom' to SpecCP is triggered, and [uWh] is deleted in a spec-head configuration under AGREE with 'whom'. 

(8) [Nobody's mother] likes anybody [but herself] 

(i) [Everyone] [but Sally] jumped into the swimming pool (ii) [No one] [but Sally] jumped into the swimming pool (iii) [All boys] [but John] jumped into the swimming pool (iv) ?? [Each boy] [but John] jumped into the swimming pool. - Not sure about this one (iv) # [Most boys] [but John] jumped into the swimming pool (v) # [Some boys] [but John] jumped into the swimming pool (vi) # [The team] [but John] jumped into the swimming pool (vii) # [A group of boys] [but John] jumped into the swimming pool 

As desired, the grammar only generates strings ww (w concatenated with itself), where w is an arbitrarily long sequence of a, b and c in any order. 

The fact that a reflexive (probably a logophor in this case) can be bound in the exceptive phrase by the subject shows that the exceptive phrase is c-commanded by the subject even when the two are discontinuous: 

We can see that other wh-words do count as interveners by considering the well known superiority effects: 

(7) [No one] shaved himself [but John] 

To answer your question of how "native English speakers translate the nominative cases in their brains" - assure you that we get by! More seriously, Jean Vergnaud, in a 1977 letter to Chomsky & Lasnik (http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262062787_sch_0001.pdf) suggested that all languages possess 'abstract' case underlyingly, and it just so happens that it is spelled-out in languages like Czech, and not in languages like English, Chinese etc. This means that in English, abstract case is assigned based on the structural position of the Noun Phrase - for example, the grammatical subject is assigned abstract nominative, and the grammatical object is assigned accusative case. This conception of case is quite widely accepted in generative linguistics. It's worth emphasising that on this view, case is purely syntactic - it is not taken to dictate the semantic role of a Noun Phrase. A nominative subject can, e.g. be an agent ("She hit John") or a patient ("She was hit by John").
