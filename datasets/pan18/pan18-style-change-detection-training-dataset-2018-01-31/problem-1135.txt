No, a player cannot be penalised for an action against a teammate that is normally (only) a foul if done to the opponent. If an attacker has left the field deliberately, this means that even if they re-enter and place themselves in an onside position, they will continue to be considered to be in an offside position (unless the second-last defender is on the goal line) until the defensive team clears the ball towards halfway, outside the penalty area. Whether a player is in an offside position or not is determined when the ball is last played by a teammate. This is described (albeit in a poorly worded manner) on p. 36 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game (emphasis on relevant phrases mine): In the game of association football, the ball is always out of play when it crosses the line either in the air or on the ground. It never has to hit the ground to be out, like in other forms of football, such as rugby. From page 33, 2014/15 FIFA Laws of the Game: Thanks to posdef, here is a clip of Cuauht√©moc Blanco using this technique. p. 21 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game: Law 11 makes no distinction between intentionally and unintentionally placing oneself in an offside position: In other friendlies, any number may be used, but if the referee is not informed before the match, only six substitues may be used. This means that if a player who has left the field deliberately re-enters the field of play and involves themselves in active play before the ball has been played by the defending team towards halfway, out of the penalty area, and they are not penalised for offside, they must be cautioned for re-entering the field of play without permission. If this occurs, an indirect free kick is awarded to the defending team. and in the Offside FAQ section: If this puts the restart location inside the goal area, the restart may be taken from any point within the goal area. is closest to the goal line (p.86 - FIFA 2014/15 Laws of The Game).
