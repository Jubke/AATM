Yes, there is, and for the same reason there is evidence against the 'no tampering' computational principle of current Merge-based minimalist syntax: sublexical elements (typically 'features', [attribute: value] pairs) must be visible to computational operations and result affected by them (e.g., unvalued [A:v] pairs get valued as a result of syntactic operations),and, conversely, sublexical [A: v] features trigger/block syntactic operations. Also, at the semantic level, 'coercion' modifies the internal features of lexical items as they get constructed with neighbouring lexical items, and not only 'locally' (as a consequence of direct 'external Merge' between two lexical units L1 and L2), but also non-locally, as when a noun or verb undergo 'meaning coercion' resulting from NPs or VPs being subsequently constructed with e.g. certain adverbials. Under a strict view of lexical integrity, none of that should occur. Needless to say, parallel reasoning applies to the 'phonological' component of the grammar to the extent sub-lexical phonological features can be affected by comparable features of neighbouring lexical items, obvious cases being 'sandhi' and vowel harmony phenomena. Finally, of course 'lexical integrity' cannot be a principle of any grammar in which at some point (say 'Spell Out', in standard minimalist grammar) the computation branches into two sub-computations, one sending 'meaning'-related information towards the 'conceptual-intentional interface' and the other sending 'sound'-related information towards the 'articulatory-perceptual' one. The latter argument, of course, applies only to theories like Chomsky's minimalist grammar, but the preceeding ones, terminological issues aside, are more generally applicable to all theories of grammar I am aware of to the extent they are explicit as to the computations they presuppose. 

Of course, going any further is out of the question: even 'translating' the principles of current CG-based grammars into a framework that denies the existence of phrasal dependents (in spite of the fact that there is unquestionable evidence that natural language is structure-dependent) may well be literally impossible, as partly explained above, and as to DG's alternatively developing equivalent principles of its own to properly handle the empirical effects of constituency, allowed and disallowed displacement, correct and incorrect scope, minimality, superiority, island constraints, correct and incorrect binding, control, ellipsis, deletion and empty category effects, etc., well, I will not say it is 'impossible', but none of that remotely exists yet and everything suggests that if a proper theory of 'all that' ever comes to be developed from a strict DG point of view, it will be rather more stipulative and complex, and rather less efficient, than state-of-the art constituency-based grammars. 

Therefore, if X-Bar Theory was to stand, as desired, it was necessary to find a way to reanalyse the 'sentence' as a 'headed' construction, and, since S consisted of only two 'immediate constituents', the NP (functioning as the 'subject') and the VP (functioning as the 'predicate'), only two possibilities seemed available: either S was an expansion of the NP (and ultimately of N, according to the X-Bar principles), or the head of S was the VP and S was an expansion thereof, and ultimately of the finite verb. 

Of course, it must be the ‘phrase’ S, in this case, ergo phrasal nodes must be syntactically relevant categories or it would be impossible to define sent as the ‘root’ or ‘head of’ anything. Q.E.D. 

Thus, under these alternative assumptions, the simplified structure of e.g. 3a would be [His candour] [struck me [PredP: PRO [Pred’: as [AP: trace/copy of PRO [excessive]]]]], which satisfies Theta Theory and solves the interpretation problem. Case-wise, such an analysis raises no problem, either: PRO can only receive Null Case (or, being phonetically empty, no Case at all, depending on which theory of PRO is adopted within P&P meta-theory), but, either way, it is fine in both Spec AP and Spec PredP. Movement-wise, PRO need not (and, in fact, by virtue of Economy, cannot), raise beyond Spec Pred (i.e., there must be PRO-raising from Spec A into Spec Pred, but there cannot be any subsequent PRO-raising from PredP into any higher specifier). Thus, in sum, claiming that the apparently missing argument of excessive or farfetched is a silent PRO solves the interpretation problem and causes no Case, Theta Criterion or Movement Theory violations, which accounts for the grammaticality of the ‘active’ sentences 3a and 4a. 

Ernst’s 2002 book, Jackendoff’s much earlier (1972) one, Ross's and other 'generative semanticists' work in the late 60's and early 70's, Beth Levin's work, Abney's dissertation, and a few other works (including those in other linguistic traditions, especially Fregean-Montagovian and Categorial Grammar, but also Dik’s and Rijhoff’s FG work on the structural levels in the clause and the NP, respectively, and Hengeveld’s recent work on Functional Discourse Grammar, however sloppy its 'LF' may be) have contributed to some extent to ground a few of those functional categories, but most remain purely stipulative (actually, most of the base-generated categories a Cinquean analysis entails do not even have an adequate descriptive name, not to mention the innumerable additional and completely ad hoc categories that must be posited if observed surface order is to be derived from a Kayne/Cinque-style account of base-generated structure).
