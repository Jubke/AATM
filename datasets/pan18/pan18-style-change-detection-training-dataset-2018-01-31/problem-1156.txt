"Bagel girl" is a derogatory term for a woman who frequently loses tennis sets 6-0. The stereotypical bagel girl is a young woman from a wealthy family who has enough money to keep traveling the world and entering professional tournaments, even though she has no chance of winning at that level. 

This section of the rule book does not specify a penalty for skipping other commitment tournaments. The Rankings section of the rulebook reveals the penalty. If the other commitment tournaments are skipped, they are counted against the player for ranking purposes. 

A player can get the number of ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment tournaments reduced by meeting certain milestones, based on longevity in the league.

Summarizing, open pattern generates more spin than the closed pattern but even for the same pattern spin produce will differ because of tension of strings. Considering both 16 x 18 and 16 x 19 have same tension there will be little variation on produce spin. 

An article from Tennis Warehouse University has done a research on Spin and String Pattern few important parts summary related with this question are:

Spin: Fewer strings create larger “squares,” grip the ball more, and result in more spin 

How open pattern affect on-court performance:Source 

Even if the two rackets are of same pattern in our case open pattern, tension also plays part in producing spin. Following two figures obtained from the website shows the spin ratio for open pattern with high and low string tension.(For pattern 16 x 18) 

Rackets with more vertical and horizontal strings – e.g. 18 x 20 – are described as having a “dense or closed” pattern, while rackets with less vertical and horizontal strings – e.g. 16 x 18, 16 x 19 – are considered to have an “open” pattern. All these string patterns are most common. As per your question, 16 x 18 and 16 x 19 can be considered as open pattern one and has a difference of one string only.
