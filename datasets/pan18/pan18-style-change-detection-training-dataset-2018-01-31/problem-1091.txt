I think in Europe almost all coaches have an agent, so I do not understand why there is so much difference in the negotiations between a coach (not free) and a footballer From the FIFA rules of the game about position of the ball (law 14 at page 45) says I think because female football is played by a few number of players than men's one. So it is more difficult to find new strong player to play with national teams. So it easy for the coaches to "use" experienced players to find better results The team was insert in Group I and has played friendly against other team of the same Group The four best third teams will play knockout against the winner of the groups A-B-C-D On the picture belows some images from guardian source: from the last one is possible to notice that only football has an official women League In american football and basketball is often easy to find it called as man defensive mannequin. Is it used in football/soccer training to increase precision penalty (so is called (slave) defensive template barrier) â€¢ must remain on his goal line, facing the kicker, between the goalposts until the ball has been kicked. FIFA matches UEFA matches National league matches In all this case it is possible to have players coming from different nationality. CSKA (Central Army Sports Club - CSKA Moscow) => football - futsal - icehochey - basketball - volleyball I know in Spain Real Madrid Castilla, Real Madrid's second team, play in the same league system as the first team. Are there other countries in which the same situation occurs, and if so which ones? I do not know if it exists a "real" name for it, but those are probably the easy denomination you can find for it Those are the table of Champions League finals and Europa League finals
