The only bikes which should have no brakes on them are possibly those used in a velodrome (i.e. track bicycles which are actually used ONLY on a track). [Here, it is actually dangerous to have brakes.] Reach is the distance between the center of the brake bolt and the middle of the brake shoe. Generally, brakes are sold with a range of reach (usually written on the brake; this is because you have some adjustment with the pads), like 40 mm - 50 mm or whatever and are termed as short, normal, long and extra long reach (but the actual reach lengths vary based on the manufacturer and time period of manufacturing, so you need to look at the range of reach for the particular brake you're using; for example, a long reach brake today may have been a normal reach brake in the 1960s). People also use drop bolts to use shorter reach brakes when longer reach brakes are required. A long pull lever (i.e. for V-brakes, mountain mechanical discs) pulls the cable about twice as long (but about half as hard) as a short pull lever (caliper, cantilever, road discs). The brake you use depends on your hand position. For example, if you're on the top of the brake hoods or drops, you'd probably use the regular drop bar brake levers. If you're near the middle of the bar, you'd probably use the interrupter lever. The hand position is a matter of personal preference (nobody's stopping you from riding only in the drops all the time), but depending on how you're riding, some of the levers will be natural one to use. Modern bicycles have interrupter levers, which push the housing rather than pull on the cable to activate the brakes. They don't have the drawbacks of suicide levers, and you can effectively apply the brake from the interrupter lever or from the regular brake lever. You can switch between the systems with a travel agent. Some levers also have a switch which can work with both types with the flick of the switch (Shimano ST-EF65 shifters+brake levers, for example).
