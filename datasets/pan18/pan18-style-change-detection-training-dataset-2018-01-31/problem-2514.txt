First off, phonetics is not about features, though often in introductory classes if you don't have separate courses on phonetics and phonology, phonetics gets lumped together with phonology. Second, it is simply wrong to say that liquids and nasals are [+cons,-syll]. The misstatement comes from confusing the most common properties of a system with the inherent properties of the system. Liquids and nasals are [+cons,+son] and if you want to distinguish syllabic versus non-syllabic liquids / nasals (the latter are more common), you can employ [syllabic] to do that – syllabic liquids/nasals are [+cons,+son,+syl] and nonsyllabic liquids are [+cons,+son,-syl]. That assumes the classical SPE feature system, and in fact syllabic was one of the first features to be disposed of in the 70's. Textbooks may use the SPE system because it does represent the last standard for representation, but there are many current theories of representation, and none of them employ a feature [syllabic]. There are many different accounts of the difference, virtually all of which rely on some prosodic object such as a mora, V-slot, or nuclearly prespecified X-slot (there is also a non-standard redefinition of [consonantal] where glides are [+consonantal] and corresponding vowels are [-consonantal], but as far as I know that has not been applied to the difference between syllabic and non-syllabic consonants. You should take any such claims with a large grain of salt. While there is no question that Toda has a contrast, it is not evident that the phonetic realization is [ɕ] vs. [ʃ]. Ladefoged & Maddieson in The sounds of the world's languages 156ff list the Toda sibilants as [s̻ s̱ ʃ ʂ] and [ɕ] is not listed. They also list the Ubykh sibilants as [s ŝ ɕ s̥], without [ʃ] (they state that [ʃ] does not occur in Ubykh and Abkhaz). Although the wiki entry on ɕ lists Norwegian as having that sound, Kristofferson in The phonology of Norwegian lists it as [ʂ], and the wiki entry on Norwegian likewise does not include [ɕ]. Ladefoged & Maddieson put their charcoal where their informants' mouths are and substantiate the claim that Toda has [s̻ s̱ ʃ ʂ]. I argue that to make that specific a claim (that a language has [ɕ] rather than [ʃ] or [ʂ]), one must use some articulatory-measurement method, or, one must be Ian Catford or Peter Ladefoged (both of whom, alas, have another thing in common). There is no general answer to the question of how liquids and nasals become syllabic: there are many answers, and it just depends on the facts of the language. In English, it mostly has to do with unstressed syllables having əC where C is a sonorant. In many languages it has to do with extraneous consonants that can't be syllabified around a vowel but where there is a sonorant that can fill the bill (Sanskrit, for example). A number of languages of West Africa have CR̩V syllables with syllabic pre-vocalic consonants, and these often derive from disyllables (*pila) which lose a vowel (→ [pl̩a]). The situation with English is different from that of Korean in that English only has two kinds of underlying consonants as opposed to three in Korean, and "what is underlying" is one definition of "phonemic". But the other definition of "phonemic" refers only to phonetic outputs and the ability to reduce two phonetic categories to one by rule, referring only to available phonetic properties and not abstract phonological ones. Because of resyllabifications (an abstract phonological process), you can actually get all three stop types in comparable contexts: "a Benny" (unaspirated), "up any" (lightly aspirated), "a penny" (most aspirated). This is typically dealt with by referring to juncture / word boundary, but junctures or boundaries are not phonetic events, they are abstract phonological units. Since I don't subscribe to the strict surface-oriented view of the concept "phoneme", I don't know whether advocates of that theory would then hold that English also has "degrees of aspiration". This handout and paper by Vaux gives an overview of relevant facts and theoretical interpretations of the matter. What makes Korean so special is that it has a third kind of consonant, transcribed typically as pp, which is termed 'fortis; tense; glottal; geminate' – all of these seem to be appropriate descriptions of the facts. These 'tense' consonants have an even lower VOT, which is the element missing for claiming that there are "degrees of aspiration:. However, the 'tense' consonants also have some kind of glottalization associated with them, at least for older speakers. It is possible that some time in the future, the p, pp, ph contrast will develop into a three-way difference in aspiration alone, but at present, there are enough other differences associated with these consonants that we can legitimately treat the system as having two orthogonal two-way differences (aspiration versus glottalization). Korean has been subject to a half century of acoustic analysis, and it is clear that there has been recent language change where /p/ et al. in Seoul Korean have become "more aspirated", over time and compared to other dialects. It is now to the point that the unaspirated stops of Seoul Korean are comparable in voice onset time to the contrastively aspirated stops of languages like Apache and Khonoma Angami (Cho & Ladefoged). Some languages have extreme degrees of aspiration, for example Navaho [k] at 45 msc vs [kʰ] at 154 msc; 28 and 128 msc respectively for the same pair in Tlingit. From that perspective, p in Korean is "somewhat aspirated" and ph is "more aspirated, compared to Bengali or other Indic languages where the phonologically unaspirated stops don't have a very long VOT at all.
