The verse informed them of their entitlement to settle their dispute in a fair manner: a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, etc. Retribution is not mandatory; Allah says in the same verse that "whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct". Those who were killed with no retribution, the Prophet ﷺ ordered blood money to be paid in compensation. If Christians and Jews follow what Allah has revealed in their books, they would follow the Prophet ﷺ: 

When it comes to favors, He said "whom You have bestowed favor", then He said "those who have evoked [Your] anger" attributing it to the people, rather than saying "those that You are angry with". And when I am ill, it is He who cures me.

This topic has been covered in several tafsir and commentary, but I will quote from the following two sources: During the time of the Prophet ﷺ, two tribes went into war (Muqatil said those two tribes were Banu Qurayza and Banu Nadir). The war resulted in a number of casualties on both sides, and a number of prisoners of war. The stronger tribe vowed to take retribution for each one of their slaves or their women from a free member of the weaker tribe, and for each man of theirs from two men of the weaker tribe. 

It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: "The blood of every Muslims is equal, they are one hand against others. The asylum offered by the lowest of them in status applies to them (all), and the return is granted to the farthest of them."
