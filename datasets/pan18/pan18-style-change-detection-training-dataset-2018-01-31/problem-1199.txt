So now, the question that's raised is whether this designation of Chief Executive as "appointer" is simply a mysterious formality, versus it possibly introducing tangible or even substantial effects. 

Are there any provisions in the United States Constitution, or other U.S. laws or regulations, that specifically prohibit—or otherwise preclude—the president from appointing him- or herself to the Supreme Court? 

But as for editing the title of the question, it does not feel fair to do so after so much interest and lively debate have been generated. This leads to a situation where, technically, the question as stated remains unanswered. 

The passive sentence ends there (without a "by" clause), so it puts focus on all of the "requiring" that "Article Two" is doing, without having to commit to who's doing the nominating (President), confirming (Senate), or appointing (President). Worse, I misread it, getting that the Article itself (or the Constitution) was authorizing the appointment; I actually remember thinking at the time that that was kind of weird. 

One possible consideration: At a minimum, since this would likely necessitate some overlap where the person has these two jobs at the same time, is it permissible for any single person to receive multiple paychecks from the Federal government on a given payday? 

The main reason is the winner-takes-all aspect of the system (your second reason). If you have majority vote in separate districts/constituencies, you can have many distortions, gerrymandering, etc. It's not always as visible as in the US but it does also happen to some extent in Britain, in France (in the parliamentary elections, not the presidential election in this case), etc. 

The bill has been adopted with overwhelming majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives (so-called “veto-proof majority”). One concern could therefore be that vetoing the bill would simply result in Congress passing it anyway, humiliating Trump and again feeding the controversy around the president's attitude towards Russia. 

But if you read Montesquieu, separation of powers was not necessarily meant as rigidly as it was implemented in the US. The practical difficulties are numerous and modern constitutions tend to take a more nuanced approach (hence the apparent peculiarity of the US system compared to much of what came later). More recent constitutions also tend to be (much) longer than the US constitution. 

I just came across an article making a similar argument regarding Cruz and disposing of his candidacy in a couple of paragraphs before turning to Trump vs. Rubio. Right or wrong, this is quickly becoming conventional wisdom, not some sort of wild prediction from PredictWise. 

And the US was charting new territory, there wasn't much past experience to look back on. Even the very idea of a written constitution in the modern sense was kind of new (there were a few like Corsica but most European states didn't have one). 

A minor detail is that the president is supposed to check whether the candidates meet formal requirements like being a German citizen or meeting age requirements. 

Another example you might consider is the way the Bundesrat is elected. Without getting into the details, you can easily see that it's several times removed from the popular vote. And the composition of the Bundesrat does matter for the election of the president in Germany (who has a much smaller role than the US president, of course, so that's where the comparison ends). 

More importantly, none of this is clearly defined in the constitution but stems from a tradition established around the time the current constitution was enacted. The framers of the constitution might have intended for the president to have a more active role and there is nothing formally preventing it. 

[edit: correction] From the comments, @phoog points out that, in fact, after Senate confirmation, it is the duty of the President to formally make the appointment. My mistake in the above was to use information from Wikipedia, which currently states: 

For the purposes of this question, we can assume the Chief Executive is a judge or lawyer and ostensibly qualified to serve as a Supreme Court Justice.

In the US, it does kind of work however because the lower levels of government and the courts have a bigger role than in many other countries, including England (I am not writing “the UK” because the institutions of Scotland and Northern Ireland also have extensive powers).

This shows that avoiding open conflict and, to this date, always following the advice of the chancellor does not mean the president has absolutely no influence in the process. At the same time, breaking with tradition is not risk-free and that means such a prerogative can only be used in really serious cases.
