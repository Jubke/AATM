Clement of Alexandria taught a similar doctrine, saying "It is not right that these should be condemned without trial, and that those alone who lived after the coming should have the advantage of the divine righteousness." I also found these books in my research on the answer to this question: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802806155/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1 Early Christians were divided on this. 

Many of the original ideas were developed in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. The idea is that all people are born under Original Sin and therefore do not a priori get to go to Heaven. Authors like Dante portray Virtuous Pagans who lived before Jesus as not even able to get into Purgatory but are in the first circle of Hell. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_of_the_unlearned We see that Abraham's faith was counted to him as righteneousness, and of course we know that Abraham was God's friend and had experienced God's revelation directly. Because of this direct experience and revelation, he was willing to stop relying on his reason and go up to sacrifice his son Isaac. From this we learn once again that the level of personal experience and revelation plays a crucial role in judging someone's actions. 

Molinists (such as William Lane Craig) on the other hand believe that God knows what a person would choose in any given situation. They point to passages like Matthew 11:20-24 Source: http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/aprilweb-only/12.0a.html Source: http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4159 

My personal view is that being saved means eternal reconciliation to God and being in the Kingdom of God forever. Since God is all good, and just, and merciful, it seems very strong to me that God will save everyone who desires to be saved, or would have desired it if they had the choice. Even if they had incomplete information, they will eventually be saved. They may have to pay for their sins but eventually everyone will be in the Kingdom of God forever who would have wanted to be in it if they knew what that meant. Many times there will be a special collection for missions or charities. Then you know you're giving will directly help the needy, by those who can help them best. 

491 Through the centuries the Church has become ever more aware that Mary, "full of grace" through God,134 was redeemed from the moment of her conception. That is what the dogma of the Immaculate Conception confesses, as Pope Pius IX proclaimed in 1854: 

492 The "splendor of an entirely unique holiness" by which Mary is "enriched from the first instant of her conception" comes wholly from Christ: she is "redeemed, in a more exalted fashion, by reason of the merits of her Son". The Father blessed Mary more than any other created person "in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places" and chose her "in Christ before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless before him in love".
