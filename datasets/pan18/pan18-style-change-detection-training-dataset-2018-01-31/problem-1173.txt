Economics is complex and the entire minimum wage debate is huge. There's all sorts of factors involved and one has to really look at the debate in context. And, in the end, I think Vice (a--well--Vice is Vice) sum it up succinctly: https://news.vice.com/article/what-will-happen-to-the-economy-if-we-raise-the-minimum-wage If you think markets are strongly efficient, then insider trading is not a problem. I don't think all libertarians believe that it's impossible to make money off of insider information, but their faith in markets means many libertarians find the strong EMH more compelling than the average voter. I think there are a number of excellent answers, which I in no way want to detract from, but I want to introduce one more problem with this scheme. This creates a perverse incentive to spend one's wealth rather than saving it. Consider the case where 2 people each make 1million dollars per year; clearly the kind of people this system is designed to tax. One person, let's call him Gatsby throws extravagant parties, flies all over the world, and consumes expensive caviar, saving only 10% of his income. The other person, let's call him Warren, lives modestly(by millionaire standards) and saves 50% of his income. By the time they've both been working for 20 years, Warren has 10 million dollars in wealth (really quite more than that thanks to investment and compound interest) and Gatsby has 2 million dollars in wealth. A theoretical objection to insider trading is the strong efficient market hypothesis(EMH). Weaker efficient market hypotheses say that people can't make money off of publicly available information. Many people believe this. The strong efficient market hypothesis states that individuals cannot beat the market even if using inside information. One example definition is: For a country to specialize away from industry it will need, peaceful neighbours with comparative advantage in industry and the ability to transport the services and raw materials the country has comparative advantage in producing. The country might also need intellectual property treaties if it will trade in intellectual property. Another libertarian approach to reform insider trading laws, here expressed in an article from the Foundation for Economic Education, is to let corporations opt out of insider trading protections. Gibson proposes that instead of using the state to prosecute insider trading, corporate bylaws should define what insider trading is and how it should be punished financially. If corporations defined and punished insider trading, then competition would lead to more effective ways of getting back money from fraudulent insiders especially compared to relying on a stagnant government bureaucracy.
