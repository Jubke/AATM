Currently it sounds like your son knows that if he waits he will get the food types he wants. Clever, eh :-) The only real solution is to stick to a rule of 

What you describe is not a fear of blood - in fact studies show any fear of blood is learned, not innate - but instead your baby will have picked up on a couple of things: 

Children learn very early on that they can get Mum and Dad to do anything - at daycare, I'm assuming the staff don't bend quite as much. 

You can understand why babies and toddlers may do that - your body is the source of their comfort and happiness. It is normal for them to do it, although a more common comfort is sucking the thumb, for example. 

Of the two, I think the 2nd is most likely. As @Beofett comments: 

If it makes you uncomfortable, you could think about dissuading the activity, especially if your culture will not accept it in public. 

My cousin's daughter is now 3.5 years old. She still uses diapers all the time and does not tell ever that she needs to go to the toilet. 

Should I actually force her to speak these/the English words at this age (by repeatedly asking her to speak)? 

I have found that child is more comfortable with Hindi words rather than the English. 

Child has learnt that and follows the practice whenever she sees a photo of those gods. 

She speaks tortoise, monkey, and money correctly. 

I speak English at home with the child and the other person too. 

And now my toddler is 2 years old and when I say - A for, she says ant, so on and so forth till W. 

Child is currently 2 years old. 

When I speak English, I find that my pronunciation is same for all the similar sounding words mentioned above. 

Timeouts don't work - I have tried to make her sit and hold her and count till 150. It doesn't seem to bother her much as she sits calmly. Definitely it will bother her if I count till 250 but that requires too much effort on my part. It is tiring for me.
