For example, a rumor that there is a CIA station in Windsor, Ontario is not as powerful as an acknowledgement by the U.S. government that this is the case. Until the government confirms the information, it can be dismissed as unreliable or a conspiracy theory. 

The geographic extent of the culture of honor in the United States (as noted in the earlier links) also has little overlap with the urban areas with the highest rates of gun violence in the United States (noted in the New York Times op-ed first linked in this Answer), so this explanation also embraces the notion that a culture of honor is not tempered by the consequences that loose gun control may have elsewhere which its proponents do not necessarily experience themselves.
