Not claim the right to vote elsewhere I suppose that if Peter Parker claimed the right to vote, then this would legally prevent Spider-Man from registering to vote, since they are one and the same. But if Peter Parker did not claim the right to vote, I think that he would legally be in the clear on this. Impeachment is solely the responsibility of Congress, so the President cannot unilaterally impeach the Vice President, or any other elected official in the federal government. Given all this my answer is that Yes, Spider-Man can register to vote and would be legally allowed to actually vote on Election Day.

Since a census is performed every 10 years, the number of representatives are recalculated through a process called aportionment. The most recent reaportionment as of the time of this writing was on December 21, 2010 (following the 2010 census). A number of states changed with the biggest gain being Texas receiving four additional Electoral Votes and the biggest losses being Ohio and New York losing two Electoral Votes each. The next aportionment will occur after the 2020 census, which will affect the 2022 congressional election and the 2024 presidential election. For instance, Barack Obama was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. However, his cabinet appointments were not confirmed until days or even months afterwards: Every state gets two Senators, so they get two Electoral Votes. They also get representatives proportional to their population (minimum one), so they get at least one more Electoral Vote.
