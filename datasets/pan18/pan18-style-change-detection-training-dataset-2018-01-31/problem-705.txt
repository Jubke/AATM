The 'Camel' which can protect and feed itself. The camel can be compared to any potentially un-harmable object eg. a stone slab etc. These things should not be picked up. 

One thing you should obviously be cautious is that when nasal or oral bleeding occurs, maximum care should be taken not to let the blood down the throat. 

Cupping/Hijama is a process that sucks blood through a small incision made in a person's skin. 

However, Hanbali school debates that Cupping invalidates the fast, NOT due to the flow of blood, but because of the temporary weakness it offers. This is albeit a different question you could ask. 

If you don't know what cupping is, go through this page from Wikipedia.

What to do when you find an unclaimed (lost) property: The first thing you have to do if an unclaimed object comes in your custody is make a public announcement. Then wait for a year to see if the owner returns. If he doesn't you can utilize it. 

The 'Sheep' which is potentially harmable. The sentence "It is for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the wolf." means that till the owner finds it, if you don't guard it, the wolf will have its meal. The sheep here can be compared to any fallen object not abled (designed) to protect itself eg. a book, cash, cell phone, etc. and the wolf can be compared to any harm that can be caused. So you should pick it up, make a public announcement and guard it for a year. If the owner still doesn't turn up, you can keep it for yourself.

The preferred option however is to seek her consent because of the source material quoted above. A non-virgin can not be married against her consent according to the Shafis. Lack of wealth IS a barrier to suitability, and its listed in your quotation (profession).

This is similar to how the Sahabah prevented the Muslim women from visiting the mosques after the death of the Prophet (p.b.u.h), whereas the Prophet had said: "Do not prevent the women servants of Allah from the Mosques"(Bukhari), in so far that Ayesha said: "If the Prophet was alive in our time he would have also prevented the women from visiting the mosques, just like how the women of the Jews (Israelites) do not visit the mosques (synagogues)". 

If they are married away by someone other than the father and the grandfather, then, each one of them will have the option upon attaining puberty; if they like they can maintain the contract and if they like they can revoke it.

Collatéral agnates, such as whole brother, or half brother on the father's side or father's brother, cannot in any way engage the hand of a daughter under-âge ; and a woman who has lost her virginity must manifest her consent in explicit terms, when collatéral agnates give her in marriage. As to an adult virgin, it is enough that she does not oppose the choice of her collatéral agnates. 

Number 6: God says: "That they will be known" This is more suitable that the free women are distinctly identified so they are not confused with the slave women. When they are known, people will show reverence and respect to them and will not come in their way due to their status. It is narrated about Umar that when he saw a slave woman in hijab he punished her, indeed he did that to protect the [sanctity?] of the clothes of the free women.
