I know I need to hit deep, don't ever give her a short ball. Anything else I should do? 

Solution so far is to try to pass her with topspin more often, avoid slicing it back when she's at the net and putting pressure on me. 

I think I just had a bad day. I could have played better, deep backhands and more aggressive. 

If I put a low topspin to their feet, they usually miss it, instead of mishitting it, but the ball doesn't end up in the net, sometimes they hit it up, and out. 

This term has been commonly used as as a slang as far as the 20's in American English. 

The article ends with the conclusion that you should use a one-handed backhand for slice, and a two-handed backhand for topspin. 

She neutralized my topspin by just returning a well placed low pace ball, mostly to my backhand. She could place it well to my backhand. I made a lot of mistakes due to my backhand. 

In tennis you should use your body to create power and spin. If you use your wrist as a main driver for your swing you could be more prone to wrist injuries. I know my share of people with wrist injuries due to having poor form. You should avoid using your wrist as much as possible. Try to rotate your torso and hip to get more power. Put your whole upper body into the shot. Your legs have a purpose too. Bend your knees. You need to use your entire kinetic chain, not just the arms. I recommend taking private lessons with a good pro if you can afford. There are also lots of videos on YouTube that show you how to hit with good technique. There is a lot of discussion on the use of the wrist in tennis. I am not a pro, and I am old, so I tend to play on the safe side. 

I lost to this very good doubles player (leftie) who rarely plays singles. That was embarrassing, given that I only play singles. It was close, but I am 100% sure I can beat her. 

Wondering if #1 is better suited for older players who don't want more strain on their lower legs/ankles.
