Please note that these are the "official" rules. Each casino or home-game organizers can make up their own rules. However, you'll rarely see this, since it's pretty standard. 2). The check-check situation. This also applies to the community cards. And to the different ranks of cards as well (not just the suits). Which means that there's the same chance of someone making a straight or a flush when there 3 players at the table or 8 players. Let's strip it down to its core: Pocket pairs are good because if you go against an opponent that doesn't have a pocket pair, he needs to hit the flop/turn/river somehow in order to have showdown value. You don't have to connect to the flop to do this, because you already have a pair. Now, let's do it for 8 players. If you give 1 random card to each one, there will be: Now here's the key point: The next time you want to give to each of your 3 OR 8 players a card, the probability for each of them of getting a club, diamond, heart or spade is still 1/4, EVEN THOUGH there may be more or less cards in the deck. 7 Two Pair A♠A♣T♥T♣8♠ Two cards of the same rank and two cards of the same rank. If both pair are the same rank then it is four of a kind. The top pair wins. Top pair can tie so in that case the lower pair is the tie breaker. After that kicker rules. Odds: 20.0 : 1 Announced: X up Up versus Over is the distinction in announcing two pair versus boat. Flop You bet the pot so villain was not getting direct odds to call a draw. TT is usually going to hold up here. A Q would call here that you are ahead of. In that situation if you put your opponent on AA or KK then you were barely getting pot odds to call with QQ. In position I think 22-JJ AKs would just call. You have a block on QQ. Call 6 BB is only 1/5 of his stack. This is not fold shove situation. I think you should bet the flop like 1/2 the pot with top pair and a flush draw you don't have a piece of. If they raise you then you can put them AA or KK. I am just not buying that is the only hands they could be playing here. An early raise and 3bet is pretty strong. Good chance one of you have JJ+. KK does not know UTG is loose. I don't think I would look at is like that. To call that all in they need to be pushing with TT+. With ICM they need to be pushing even wider than that. 9 High card High card. After that kicker rules. Odds: 0.995 : 1 Announced: X high with an intonation of I hope it holds up You were getting pot odds to call the $6 on the flop based on two card to come but not based on one card to come Since UTG had to think about it he probably had blockers to JJ, TT or AK. You should not play 23, 34 as less ways to make straight as you don't have 3 below. (3/51)x(48/50)x(3/49)x(44/48)x(3/47) = 0.000202294 = 4944.31 The risk of 56 is if the board comes up 789 someone has TJ. If it was an early open then JT is not likely. You could have just bet out 7 for the same effect. Your bluffs are now more expensive on every street. Then follow up on the turn with like 12. 5 Straight A♠K♣Q♥J♠T♠ Five sequential cards. Ace is both high and low. Ace through 5 is often called a wheel. Ace through 10 is often called Broadway. You cannot wrap on the ace (even if there are two) - QKA23 is not a straight. Odds: 254 : 1 Announced: X high straight What does it take to price someone out of a flush draw on the turn? 4 on the board and 2 in the opponents hand. 52 - 4 - 2 = 46 cards out 9 cards left to make a flush So the odd to make the flush is 9 : 37 = 1 : 4.11 What is interesting here is you know there are no flush in your hand so the actual odds are 9 : 35 = 1 : 3.89 What bet gives your opponent exactly 0 reason to call -bet + 9/37(bet + pot) = 0 9/37 pot = (1 - 9 /37) bet 9/37 pot = 28/37 bet bet / pot = 9 / 28 = 32% You have to bet right at 1/3 of the pot for call to be a wash Your opponent should call anything up to 1/3 pot bet by you Your bet is in the pot (4/3) / (1/3) = 4 : 1 1). The last-aggressor situation. Now, let's do it for 8 players. If you give 1 random card to each one, there will be: This also applies to the community cards. And to the different ranks of cards as well (not just the suits). Which means that there's the same chance of someone making a straight or a flush when there 3 players at the table or 8 players. This applies when there is some betting activity on the river. Let's take some examples: This is a rare occurrence but, if it happens, then it's not a mistake to fold pocket Aces. Your chance of winning is less than 50 % and, since the bubble is about to burst, it makes sense. Well, obviously like everything in poker, the answer is: "it depends". 2). The check-check situation. Please note that these are the "official" rules. Each casino or home-game organizers can make up their own rules. However, you'll rarely see this, since it's pretty standard. I usually never play 22-55 unless I'm deep enough (at least 40 BB). When it comes to 66-88, the value increases a bit so you can play the hand a little more often.
