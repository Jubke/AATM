However, the problem is, with a normal roster, if you let a guy pitch 3 innings in a night, he's not going to be available for another several days after that. You play baseball every, single day almost. So you've only got 12 or 13 pitchers, and you're using up two every 5th day, you've only got two or three guys who can come in if either of your starters gets hurt or gets in trouble in a game. That's not a good position to be in. Fall ball - Played in Arizona, the fall league is where a lot of guys in the minors go after either a short season and some rest, or after a full minor league season. Triple A - This level is a mix of young guys who are close to the big leagues, old guys looking for new life and the so called AAAA players, guys who might get a short callup but are likely to spend the rest of their careers bouncing around AAA farm clubs. When a player is placed on the DL it's retroactive to the last day he played. So if the player was placed on the DL 10 days after he had last played (the limit for retroactive DL placement), he might be eligible to come off in just 5 days. Generally this is suboptimal, but teams will often let a player sit a few days to see if he can still play before placing him on the DL. Pete Schneider for the Cincinnati Reds on July 6th 1918 against the Philadelphia Phillies. The answer is 13. It has happened twice, once in a 10 inning game, and once in a 9 inning game. Other options for getting veterans down to the minors are composed of the veteran being passed through waivers (a chance for any other team to claim him), and then he can be out righted off of the 40 man roster and given a minor league assignment (which veterans can refuse if they've already been out righted once).
