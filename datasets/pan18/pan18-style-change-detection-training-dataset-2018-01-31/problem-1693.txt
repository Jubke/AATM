Also, I disagree that this is equivalent to saying that the mind can be explained in terms of neurological processes, since it is not clear what people mean by that, that statement can be stretched until it becomes vacuous; even Searle says that if we view the brain as a machine then machines can trivially have a mind; dualists do not generally disagree that qualia is a natural phenomenon generated by the brain. What if a philosopher mounted a reductio ad absurdum on nature? would he be justified if his argument was sound? Assume a philosophical zombie which is a hypothetical being that is indistinguishable from a normal human being except in that it lacks conscious experience, qualia, or sentience. As an analogy, imagine two mathematicians who reject each other's coordinate systems for a sphere on account of including a singularity point, such as a north pole - let's call it the "absurdity" of a coordinate system - and they fail to realize that you cannot "explain" a sphere with a single coordinate system which is not "absurd" - you need at least two: It is interesting that people often react badly to this speculation; both materialist and non-materialist alike are often offended and angered when presented with this idea, and I am not aware that it has ever been discussed seriously by philosophers. In fact, memory within the dream is just another aspect of dreaming; once while lucid dreaming I noticed a pleasant but out of place background music; I thought about it for a minute and then I remembered that it was the sound of my real-life TV which I forgot to turn off before going to sleep; I was quite satisfied with myself for figuring this out from within the dream world; soon after, I woke up and I was surprised that the house was totally quiet, and then I started laughing when I remembered I don't have a TV in real life. It is not really a contradiction to the claim that a TM can in principle simulate a human being. and finally, his definition for an algorithm (p. 14): I think the phenomena you write of is more commonly referred to as Qualia or experience, in philosophy of mind.
