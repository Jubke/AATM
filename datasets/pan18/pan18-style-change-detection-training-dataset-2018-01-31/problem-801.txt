Safiyya had seen in a dream when she was the bride of Kināna ibn al-Rabī' ibn Abu al-Huqayq [her second husband, who died in the Battle of Khaybar], that a moon was dropped into her lap. She told her husband of the dream, and he said "This means nothing other than you are wishing for the King of Hijāz, Mohammad. He then slapped her face a slap from which one of her eyes turned green. When she [Safiyya] was brought to the Prophet ﷺ, she still had some traces of it [the slap]. The Prophet ﷺ asked her what that was, and she told him the story. In the khutba of a Friday prayer, 'Umar ibn Al-Khattab responded to your question: — Sahih Muslim » Legal Punishments » Hadith 1690 a He said: "I saw some people in the masjid sitting in circles, waiting to pray. In each circle, they had pebbles in their hands, and a man would say: "Say 100 takbirs." They then would do so. Then he would say: "Say 100 tahlils." They then would do so. Then he would say: "Say 100 tasbihs." They then would do so. Ibn Mas'ūd asked: "What did you tell them?" Abu Musa replied: "I did not tell them anything. I am waiting for your opinion or your command." Ibn Mas'ūd wondered: "Why did you not order them to count their sins, and guarantee to them that their good deeds would not be lost?" I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, “Allah will admit three persons to Jannah for one arrow; the maker who has a good motive in making it, the one who shoots it, and the one who hands it up for shooting. So shoot and ride, but I like shooting more than riding.” Is using a microphone speaker system for adhān an innovation? No. The conclusion is the hadith is very weak, without even having to dig into the "named man" to see who he was (which it is thought to be 'Abdul-Rahman ibn Zaid, who is also weak). For your information, there is another hadith that can be found in multiple books of hadith with the same opening statemen (see Sunan Ibn Majah, Book 1, Hadith 229), but it is also a weak hadith.
