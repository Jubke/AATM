My teenage son will often ask questions or make glib observations about things, he already knows the answer to, or understand at a deeper level. He does this to get attention and to get a reaction from me. 

I've also had the situation of trying to introduce a new man into my children's lives (their father died when they were little) and forming a relationship with his daughter. 

Even though, his death was a long time ago, we are still faced with the problem when people, naturally, ask how their Dad (my husband) died. There were times when I drilled them to lie and say he died of a heart attack. The other day I took a deep breath and told another mother, that he committed suicide. She rarely ties her hair back when it is damp. She still tends to like tight pony tails (as all her friends are doing the same), but we have managed to change her routine sufficiently, so that her hair is growing back, noticeably, to its original thickness. They have suffered through many childhood taunts, at times, including: "Your father killed himself because he didn't want to look after you." I think this is a key point. This was the first Halloween one of my children has gone out unsupervised and it was this that worried me. I generally tell them, that it's ok for them to feel, however they feel, in fact, it can be quite natural. However, I do point out clearly that it's not ok to launch into tirades, insults or abuse because they are not happy with the limits I've set. It's an ongoing process, as many adults have difficulty with behaviour, teenagers are on a steep learning curve. The increasing desire to be independent and "grown up", mixed with the conflict of still needing the nurturing and protection of a parent. Add to this all the hormone changes and it's amazing human beings manage to mature at all.
