This is probably how the EU officials are really thinking (Merkel seems to be an exception, doesn't insist on speed) but it's highly disputable whether this strategy is realistic. There is a widespread opinion that the EU simply cannot continue along the same path towards ever deeper integration and ever greater arrogance of power that we observed before the referendum. 

The U.K. voters have voted to be "out" so if their voice will be respected, and that's surely what one expects in this cradle of democracy and capitalism, Britain will be out regardless of all details of the type you mentioned. 

To summarize, the causal relationship goes exactly in the opposite direction than you suggest. Whether the U.K. is a member or not is an important condition that determines many aspects of the life of the country. It's not true in the opposite direction, as you suggest, that its membership can be "calculated" from the way what the life in the country actually looks like. 

The EU laws don't allow any official procedure to expel a member state from the union (they only make it possible to strip a nation of some voting rights etc.). The EU leaders are currently very impatient because a prolonged uncertainty about the status of the U.K. will energize "exit" movements in other countries. (Angela Merkel differs from the EU Commission etc., she says that there's no reason to hurry.) 

The UK has many made financial commitments. As well as agreeing the EU budget up to at least 2021, it is committed to funding various EU projects. Pensions for EU staff (including British staff), funding for development projects, funding for licencing and regulatory authorities, research and more have all been agreed to. 

There is also the issue of jurisdiction. The UK is adamant that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) can no longer have control after Brexit, but the EU is unwilling to allow this because the UK courts are already failing to comply with agreed EU rules. For example, the current treatment of non-EU family members is under active investigation. 

The UK has made a basic offer to give EU citizens already in the UK a fast track permanent residency application service. So far it has been a bit of a fiasco, initially requiring an 85 page form to be filled out and being rather expensive. On top of that the Home Office has been pushing hard to make people leave the country, resulting in letters threatening deportation being sent in "error". 

And your expectations about what will happen are rather unrealistic. The prospective British prime ministers don't seem to be willing to continue in the open-door immigration policies, for example. The massive influx of people from the Middle East but also from post-communist Europe will be severely reduced or stopped once the U.K. officially leaves the EU. 

Norway is more closely associated with the EU than Switzerland. But even in Norway, only a minority – 10 or 20 percent – of the EU laws apply. The percentage is much lower in Switzerland. The spirit of the Brexit discussion was that the Brits voted to be much closer to Switzerland than Norway when it comes to their relationship to the EU. 

Yes, de iure, it is possible for the future prime minister to be someone who is determined not to pay attention to the referendum. Because the U.K. Parliament picks the prime minister, it would almost certainly have to mean that a majority of the lawmakers finds this attitude acceptable, too. The only problem is that this politician and those who adopt his or her attitude are flagrantly dismissing the will of the people. It's something not expected in the U.K. which is one of the cradles of democracy, freedom, and capitalism. 

The answer whether Britain will be "in" or "out" cannot be determined solely from the assumptions you gave. If the U.K. stays in the EU, obviously "everything like elsewhere in EU" will be still true. But the reverse implication isn't quite true. And it's unlikely that the U.K. stays "in". 

This is probably how the EU officials are really thinking (Merkel seems to be an exception, doesn't insist on speed) but it's highly disputable whether this strategy is realistic. There is a widespread opinion that the EU simply cannot continue along the same path towards ever deeper integration and ever greater arrogance of power that we observed before the referendum.

On the other hand, David Cameron is already helping this scenario. The very fact that he wants to avoid the "activation of Article 50" – he doesn't want to send the letter to the European Commission saying that the departure process is being officially started and he wants his successor to do it – means nothing else than the fact that Cameron wants his successor to have the freedom to decide whether the letter is sent at all. 

The two major sticking points at the moment (October 2017) are: 

There is also the issue of jurisdiction. The UK is adamant that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) can no longer have control after Brexit, but the EU is unwilling to allow this because the UK courts are already failing to comply with agreed EU rules. For example, the current treatment of non-EU family members is under active investigation. 

Family members are also a major unresolved issue. Freedom of movement allows family members, even non-EU ones, to join the person exercising their treaty rights. This bypasses the local immigration system entirely. Failure to maintain existing rights would rip families apart.
