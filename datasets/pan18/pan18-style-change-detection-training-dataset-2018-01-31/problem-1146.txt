You can see an example (Given by @mormegil), in Group F of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Ireland and the Netherlands were “completely” tied, and their positions had to be decided by drawing of lots (won by Ireland). - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup#Group_F 

e) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned; 

d) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned; 

You can see demonstration of this technology at the following video 

The answer is drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee.

c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches. 

g) drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee. 

The section about Handling the ball explains the list of points the referee should consider before deciding the hand ball was deliberately and awarding a free kick.

b) goal difference in all group matches; 

FIFA intend for goal-line technology to be used at December's Club World Cup in Japan, and if successful it will also be implemented at the 2013 African Cup of Nations and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. 

If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings will be determined as follows: 

I also found another reference to talking about a specific case of unintentional hand ball: 

The ranking of each team in each group will be determined as follows: 

There are two issues when a back-row player sets near/above the net: 

Because the Laws of the Game define offside as (Law 11, p. 33): 

Currently, at the first hit of the team including the service, double contact is not called (provided that the contacts occur during one action, see rule 9.2.3.2), which means a great share of receptions is nowadays done using overhand, even though these hits are not clean. However, it also means todays men’s volleyball is generally: hard jumped serve which is very often a fault or an ace, or it is received nicely and properly set to a spike which ends the extremely short rally lasting just a few seconds, with such sideouting play being very predictable and boring. 

According to Rule 9, each team must play the ball within its own playing area and space (except in the case of Rule 10.1.2). Therefore, since the setter has hit the ball in the opponent’s space, the setter committed a fault. The blocker also committed a fault by touching the ball in the opponent’s space before the attack hit. However, only the first fault is penalized. 

The first one was definitely not the case here: 

Simplifying it a bit, touching the net is a fault only when 

The FIVB Rules of the Game Volleyball Casebook, 2014 edition lists several examples (examples 3.13–3.22; pages 11–12), where it is made clear that: 

Two systems, designed by technology companies GoalRef and Hawk-Eye, have been approved after going through two phases of FIFA testing. 

World soccer's global governing body FIFA and the International Football Association Board (IFAB) made the announcement following a meeting in Zurich on Thursday.

f) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned;

So the question is what deliberately means.

Today FIFA approved using Goal-line technology in soccer!

A specific answers to your questions:

c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches. 

The second one is slightly closer, but still, no go: 

Team A’s setter hit the ball above the net so that at the moment of the hit his/her fingers were in the opponent’s space. After the set the ball flew parallel to the net toward an attacker. The blocker of team B touched the ball in team’s A space, so that the team A player could not execute the attack hit. How should the 1st referee decide? 

The FIVB Rules of the Game Volleyball Casebook, 2014 edition lists several examples (examples 3.13–3.22; pages 11–12), where it is made clear that: 

(All citations from the IIHF Official Rule Book 2014–18.) 

v. In the case of misconduct penalties, the skater is allowed to return to the ice only after the first whistle after the expiration of his penalty. 

Note the rule does not forbid overhand reception of a service per se, it just requires it to be completely clean. But, presumably, unless the hit is very clean, it is going to get whistled automatically. This change also brings indoor volleyball rules a bit closer to beach volleyball, where overhand service reception is also not explicitly prohibited, but everybody receives using forearm bump, as an overhand reception would be whistled ±automatically as a double contact.
