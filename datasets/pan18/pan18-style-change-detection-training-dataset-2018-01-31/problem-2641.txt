When I looked into "canon criticism" or "canonology" a while back, I came across numerous (alleged) criteria for whether a book is/was included in canon, such as "Old Testament books had to be written in Hebrew." However, for each criteria, it seemed like there was an exception. (In this case, the book of Daniel, for instance.) 

But because of sin, we don't agree. Sin can be summarized as lust... 

The two passages being quoted in verse 20 are Psalms 69:25 and Psalms 109:8. Although these were "Psalms", clearly they were prophetic utterances by the Holy Spirit, which "had to be fulfilled." 

“For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his homestead be made desolate, and let no one dwell in it’; and, ‘Let another man take his office.’ -Acts 1:20 The answer is "sin". The only thing stopping us from having one doctrine is sin. If sin didn't enter into the equation, we would agree. 

So yes, the Gospels are also Spirit-written. All of Jesus words and His actions were authored by God, and Spirit-led. But what about the records of them? 

We all know that the 10 Commandments were written by the very finger of God, but what about the rest of the Law? So, I concluded that the Holy Spirit must have just guided the process, and that perhaps this is an instance where we cannot attribute natural reasoning, and just have to have faith. 2 Peter 3:14-16 shows that the epistles are also part of Scripture. The Psalms were the work of the Holy Spirit, and could also be considered "prophecy." (See also Matthew 22:41-44.) 

The short answer is that Paul made a general statement to this effect: Clearly given the event of Acts 2, explanations of the Spirit's ministry through us (1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, Ephesians 4, etc.), and constant claims such as the following, it can be safely assumed that the New Testament Scriptures were also Spirit-written.
