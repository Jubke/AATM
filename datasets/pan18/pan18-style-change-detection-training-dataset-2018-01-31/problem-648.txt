Not the only way to play a tournament. Some go aggressive early to build chips. 

If you hold one of the flush cards then their odds are down to 8:36. Bet closer to that 1/3 pot to not chase them as you are making money on a 1/3 pot bet. But if you are holding a flush then less chance they are on the flush draw. Your premise is they are on a flush draw. Putting a player on A hand is very dangerous. What if they are on trips and you bet 1/2 the pot and you get a turn call? What do you do when they push on the river? Have a plan! If Reinkemeier was afraid of two clubs then he should have shoved the flop. Don't check the flop if you are going to fold to another club. I get playing 86s in position. I think GTO broke on flop. Doug is going to need to fire three times and get a fold 49% of the time for GTO to work. There is no backup plan. All he has is a back door straight draw and you are not sure spades are good. 

Assume you only raise with a very narrow range then you might just call to disguise the hand and or build the pot. A few situations you might just call: 

I think this is a good chart Starting hands guide As you can see 99 is kind of on the cusp This guide is not limited to just beginners This is about same chart as Phil Gordon from Little Green book 

AA is the best head up hand Lets say bb is $2 and you can get QQ to go all in for $80 you are 80% EV = -80 + .8*(163) = $50.4 Let's say you limp to get three plus you in the pot - problem is now even against 3 decent hands you are 50% You need to get $50 each from 3 to have a better EV EV = -50 + .5*(203) = $51.5 You would need to get all three hands to invest $48 post flop to have a better EV Not going happen - three hands are not going to invest $48 more dollars each unless they hit If they hit then you go to (way) less than 50% It is easier to get $80 out of one player than $50 each out of three players Aces chance of winning goes down faster with more players than the chance of growing a big enough pot because of more players 

You have to expect more bets if you don't hit. The question is can you expect more action if you do hit? Based on these numbers I think I would play fast even without chasing off draws. 50BB behind is not enough to play that pot size fast - need to slow down to get them stacked in 3 even bets. UTG+1 like the min raise - maybe come in for 2.5 bb $50 / $100 first hand of tournament everyone starts with 300 BB If they limp you are getting 5:2 (as sb and bb are in) If they have an over-pair (4:1) then you are not getting even close pot odds
