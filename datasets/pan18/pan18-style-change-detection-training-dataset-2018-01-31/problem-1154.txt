The term comes from both the fact that a bagel is shaped like a zero and from a racial stereotype. From the 2013 ATP Official Rulebook, I. ATP Circuit Regulations, 1.07 C: If a player skips the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals without a valid excuse, they are no longer considered in good standing. I'm not aware of a male equivalent of this term. "Bagel girl" is a derogatory term for a woman who frequently loses tennis sets 6-0. The stereotypical bagel girl is a young woman from a wealthy family who has enough money to keep traveling the world and entering professional tournaments, even though she has no chance of winning at that level. This section of the rule book does not specify a penalty for skipping other commitment tournaments. The Rankings section of the rulebook reveals the penalty. If the other commitment tournaments are skipped, they are counted against the player for ranking purposes. The commitment for a commitment player is described in section D. Essentially, the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals is required, if accepted; 8 of the 9 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments are required (all except Monte Carlo), and 4 of the ATP World Tour 500 tournaments are required. A player can get the number of ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment tournaments reduced by meeting certain milestones, based on longevity in the league. IX. Emirates ATP Rankings, 9.03 Emirates ATP Rankings: B. A player who is eligible for a reduction of his ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment tournaments must be in good standing with the ATP in order to receive a reduction of required ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment tournaments. Any player that is in the Top 30 in the ATP Rankings from the previous year is considered a Commitment Player for the current year. That year, Serena Williams (33) won Wimbledon, Roland Garros and Australian Open, while Flavia Pennetta (also 33) won US Open (and retiring just after that). This is the code I used to process the data: I took data from the Tennis ATP and Tennis WTA repositories in GitHub. They do not have all the rankings, so it is not comprehensive and Logan's answer will be more accurate. In these years, two winners were above 30: Women's side Thanks to beta's comment I learnt about the GitHub repository WTA tennis rankings, results and stats. In there, we can find data of all WTA tournaments since its creation in 1968. It is beautifully put and has plenty of extra data. I just focused on the Grand Slams and found out that: In 2013, Serena Williams (31) won Roland Garros and US Open. In 2012, Serena Williams (30) won Wimledon and US Open. These are the other years were one player was 30+ when winning a Grand Slam tournament: 1985, 1986, 1990, 2016, 2017 That year, Rod Laver (born 1938) won the Grand Slam, which means he won all of them: Wimbledon, Australian Open, Roland Garros and US Open. These are the other years were one player was 30+ when winning a Grand Slam tournament: 1968, 1970, 1971, 1982, 1983, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2012, 2015, 2016. This article also says that: Federer could become the oldest Number 1 player since Andr√© Agassi. He could also become the third player to end the year in Number 1 position without winning a Grand Slam title after Jimmy Connors in 1975 and 1977 and John McEnroe in 1982. If two players have exactly the same number of points in the ATP ranking, what further criteria are used to determine which of them will be higher in the ranking? To answer my question at least partially I will add what I found out when reading ATP and WTA rulebook. In case I misunderstood something, I will be grateful for any corrections or new answers to my question. (This answer does not contain anything about Grand Slams and junior tournaments, which are governed by ITF. I also did not mention mixed doubles. But I think that it is very probable that the rules there are the same.) (Connors won his first GS title in 1974 and McEnroe in 1979. But they did not won any GS in the years listed above. Note that McEnroe did not start at French Open and Australian Open in that year. So did Connors in 1977. In 1975 Connor did not play French Open.) I will ad also link to this blog post from 2015, which analyses success rate of Top 50 players in challengers: Benoit Paire and Overqualified Challenger Contenders. The criterion for determining Lucky Loser status is determined first by the highest ranked players (in descending order) who have lost in the final round of Qualifying. (The ranking used to determine the Lucky Loser order is the same ranking used to determine the Qualifying seeding.)* If more Lucky Losers are required, the same procedure is followed for players who have lost in the second-to-last round of Qualifying, in descending rank order.
