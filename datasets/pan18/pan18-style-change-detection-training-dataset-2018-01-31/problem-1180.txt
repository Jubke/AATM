(Compare this to a closely related industry, flowers. Like grain, it's growing plants, also clearly profitable, but virtually without subsidies. ) 

In the Netherlands, employers can ask for a Certificate of Conduct (Verklaring Omtrent Gedrag, VOG). The department of justice will, given the role the person is applying for, determine if there is any objection to be found in the criminal record of the person applying. If that person has no criminal record, the VOG is always granted. If there is a criminal record, but the facts are considered irrelevant to the job, the VOG is still granted. 

The Greek economy can be compared to its neighbors, such as the Balkan states and Turkey. The new minimum wage is in line with those countries, as well as the economic performance of Greece itself. The chief goal is to combat unemployment; minimum wages cause unemployment by forbidding jobs that do not pay enough. The idea that employers would just pay more if the minimum wage is higher ignores the reality of globalization. Importantly for Greece, tourism can offer many jobs, but Greece is in direct competition with other Mediterranean states. A lower minimum wage directly helps tourism to be competitive, and can quickly create new jobs. 

Actually, the tax code does already penalise people with poor health habits. 

As for the pros and cons of structuring a system like this - that's a separate question. 

But it punishes them at the point of consumption - when they are actually doing the 'wrong thing' by following unhealthy behaviour. It doesn't penalise or discourage them at the point when they do the right thing by seeking medical help when it is needed. 

So, when people's health care is taxpayer-funded, you get best value for the taxpayer (and best health outcomes) by: 

The short answer is, it's financial, and nothing to do with punishment or blame or morals. When health is treated as a marketplace and health-providers are profit-making, anyone at a higher risk of needing expensive treatment is a greater financial risk. If it's legally allowed, their premiums will be higher, regardless of whether it's "their fault" (smokers) or "not their fault" (pre-existing / genetic conditions). 

This does leave the question of, why are non-medicare Americans who have unhealthy habits, like the asker, penalised for a second time at the point where they do the right thing in seeking medical attention when they show signs of being unwell (or in preparing for such an eventuality with insurance), when they've already paid once through taxes? 

US smokers are taxed when they buy packs, at the state, federal and sometimes municipal levels; and there are similar liquor taxes, etc. These all are applied at the point the health-damaging behaviour is initiated, and there's plentiful evidence from many worldwide studies that, depending on how these taxes are applied, they do in fact reduce things like smoking rates, particularly among younger people. Here's one such example among many from 2011 (this is disputed by the tobacco industry and its affiliated researchers and think-tanks, obviously, but the evidence is strong). For illegal drugs, obviously they're illegal - mere ownership is penalised (in some states, very strongly).

Recidivism is a serious problem - 70% of inmates will be convicted again within 6 years. Comparison with the US is a problem, however - the justice system in the Netherlands is well-known to be rather lenient (A recent media event was the public apology by the Dutch IOC member Camiel Eurlings for domestic violence - the justice department decided not to press charges because he was doing volunteer work !). More scientifically, 80% of offenders do not go to jail, and that's ignoring petty crime. For young serious offenders, that's even 95%. Hence, only the most severe criminals will become inmates, and it's not a big surprise that recidivism is a major problem in that group. 

The Greek debt crisis included a budget crisis. The debt wouldn't have been a problem if the budget was sufficiently in the black to pay interests and repay principals in time. Resolving the budget crisis meant both cutting spending and raising taxes. 

But as the Netherlands moved to a services economy (still not very industrialized), they became a net contributor to the EU. The Dutch Christian Democrats all but disappeared, and support for CAP income support disappeared entirely: "[R]esponding better to global climate and food security challenges, increasing the effectiveness of existing greening measures, simplifying current CAP rules and focusing on SMEs, will be at the core of the [2016] Dutch EU presidency"
