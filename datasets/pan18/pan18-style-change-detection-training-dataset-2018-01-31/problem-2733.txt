There is no "official" statement that I know of regarding this. The Church does not consider those who are menstruating to be unclean. There is no rule against being baptized during that time. 

Temples provide tampons for the women who are. As long as they are using one, there isn't a problem. I read what you were referring to from the link you posted. That was the opinion of the temple worker. 

A name is written down on a piece of paper by a patron, or office worker (if the name is called in), and placed in an envelope of sorts. This is put on the alter during the prayer circle. The words of the prayer is up to the officiator but generally speaking a generalized prayer that their needs will be met is said along with other things. 

In regards to the convert baptisms, I don't know of anything either way. When a woman is baptized they are not asked if they are menstruating, so there is no way to know unless the officiator is told. 

Traditionally many young-earthers like to ascribe great violence to these fountains. Both Answers In Genesis and the ICR have written papers reconciling plate tectonics with the flood, suggesting that the flood completely rearranged the planet. 

Even outside of LDS missions, just about every reputable missions agency has some form of accountability, in order to ensure that the missionary is adhering to his or her commitment. 

God would at best be his grandfather, although as stated above, orthodox Christianity states Jesus was begotten not made. In any event, Jesus and Satan can't both have been made by God, since all things that were made were made by Jesus. 

Let's digress for a second and ask who made Lucifer. 

He travelled with Barnabas, both for encouragement, and so as to have a witness that he really was now with the church. He openly talked about how having a wife would distract him from the mission. As such, the LDS practice is both practical and Scriptural. 

Genesis 7:11 describes the beginning of the flood this way: 

As John 1:3 reminds us, there was nothing made that Jesus did not make. Thus, the question is "Is Lucifer a created being?" If the answer to that question is yes, then Jesus (via 1:14) made Satan and not God. As such, John 1:3 must be wrong or they are. 

A hard-core creationist, such as Ken Hamm or the Institute for Creation Research, would have very little problem with the notion of the Ark being built in Missouri. 

What was so sacred about these 116 pages that revealing them was so bad? Was the theology contained therein of particular importance, or was the problem simply that Smith felt he should not have betrayed the command of the Angel? 

We believe that putting a name on the "prayer roll" will enable that individual with greater blessings from Heaven based on their needs. 

Edit The Church Handbook of Instructions contains nothing concerning this matter. So it is safe to say there is not a big deal. If it was, the handbook would state it.

As for the tradition, I don't know, but I did learn some things from @Daniel's link.

Along these lines, I'm curious as to the theological significance of what he translated. What was in this material that needed to be protected?
