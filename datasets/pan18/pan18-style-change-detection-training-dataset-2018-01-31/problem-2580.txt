One final note: the term phonotactics is not directly relevant for the discussion of the phonetic realization of prosodic boundaries. Phonotactics is the branch of phonology that deals with what combinations of phonemes are permitted in a language. Sometimes the phonotactics of a language can interact with its prosody such that, say, certain consonant clusters are only able to appear across syllable boundaries. 

It's not 100% accurate--it needs human correction here and there--but it might at least save you some time. ...we can see that there are 16 glottal pulses in 0.152 seconds. 16 divided by 0.152 is about 105, so the average F0 of the vowel is about 105 Hz. If we do the same for the second and third vowels, we get 91 Hz and 86 Hz, respectively. So, as expected for declarative intonation, the stressed vowel, which is also the first vowel in the word, has the highest average F0, and the F0 drops for the second vowel and then drops a bit more for the last vowel. 

Definitely. Here's a waveform of my rendition of the word prosody with a declarative intonation: 

All of this is to make the point that, yes, you are likely being influenced by your native language when you are hearing this so-called voiced velar fricative as a vowel. English doesn't have such a fricative; it doesn't even have the approximant version of it (transcribed as [ɰ]), nor are approximants allowed in that position in onset clusters (*[wga], e.g.), so it makes sense that you would map this sound to the closest thing that your native language's phonotactics would allow in that syllabic position--a mid-central-ish vowel.

They also have a modified web-interface version: 

Just for fun, I'm listing some additional notable examples below: If you take a structural phonological approach to defining those terms (i.e., if whether something is a vowel or a consonant depends on where it occurs in the syllable), then they are by definition in complementary distribution, so there's no way to prove that any vowel and any consonant aren't allophones of the same phoneme. We may say that [j] and [l] must be realizations of different phonemes, because we have minimal pairs like yes/less. Similarly, [oʊ] and [i] must be realizations of different phonemes because we have minimal pairs like boat/beat. But there can't be a minimal pair that contrasts in the inclusion of a vowel vs. the inclusion of a consonant in the same syllabic slot. Pairs like yon/eon and fro/furrow don't count, because in such cases both the segmental makeup and the syllabic structure is varying. (Note that the same is true for the French example in @cyco130's answer.) In such a model, one might look to distinctive features as a guide for identifying consonant vowel pairs that might be considered allophonic pairs. In particular, one might consider approximant/vowel pairs in French, English, etc. (of the type that @cyco130 describes) to be allophone pairs by virtue of the fact that their "features" (other than +/-syllabic) are the same. Of course this kind of criterion is entirely dependent on the feature set you use! But there are several factors that contribute to neck circumference, and not all of them are associated with larger internal organs. For example, someone with a relatively high body fat index could have a very thick neck but relatively small vocal folds. Similarly, people who take up body building and build up all of the muscles in the neck will see an increase in neck circumference but not a concomitant decrease in vocal range. 

While what @Raizin says about [əɹ] is technically true--it is supposed to denote a sequence of two phones--I have seen [əɹ], [ɚ], [ɹ̩], and [ɝ] all used to refer to the same speech sound. The thing is, while schwa is given its own place in the vowel space chart, in practice its formants (other than the first formant) tend just to be transitions between the consonants surrounding it (unless it is phrase-initial or phrase-final), so it's more of a chameleon vowel, blending into its surroundings. Consequently, a schwa-r sequence is going to be virtually indistinguishable from an 'r-colored schwa'. Furthermore, one would be hard-pressed to distinguish between unstressed [ɝ] and [ɚ]. That being said, they contend that what we phonologists have been doing for decades is codifying sets of cultural conventions shared among communities of speakers rather than any kind of internal grammars. Note that there is actually an articulatory and acoustic difference between the voiceless vowel [i̥] and the voiceless fricative [ç]. What is often described as the former is more accurately described as the latter. In the case of [i̥], the main constriction (and therefore the source of turbulent noise) is in the glottis; in [ç] it's between the tongue and the hard palate. I would argue that some realizations of /h/ in English are not voiceless vowels (as @jlawler claimed) but rather fricatives. Try pronouncing the beginning of the word huge and compare that sound to a whispered /i/ vowel. They are probably produced differently and sound different. But the /h/ in hot is pretty much realized the same as a whispered /a/ vowel. So one could make the argument that some allophones of /h/ are voiceless vowels and others (namely those before /i/ and /j/) are voiceless fricatives!
