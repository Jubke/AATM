From Elliot's commentary to the Bible for English readers: This is analogous to the case of a person who died without settling his debts, and the Prophet didn't offer his funeral but told the Sahabah to offer it: Source: Blue Letter Bible, scan on archive.org Funeral Prayer will be offered for one who kills himself. Luke 1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. Hanbali: Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah: Mary remained in the Temple until her twelfth year, at which point she was assigned to Joseph as guardian. According to Coptic tradition, her father Joachim died when Mary was six years old and her mother when Mary was eight. While the story is a legend with no foundation in history, the point is to show that even in her childhood Mary was completely dedicated to God. It is from this account that arose the feast of Mary's Presentation. The reply is is that this is talking about the first construction and laying of the foundation of the masjids, and it is not Abraham who first built the Kaaba, nor was it Solomon who first built the Bait ul Muqadas. The Kaabah was first built by Adam and then his progney spread through the earth. Hence it is valid that someone laid the foundation of Bait ul Muqadas and then it was again built later. The Quran associated the building of the Kaaba with Abraham, and it was similarly said by Qurtubi that hadith doesn't provide evidence that Abraham and Solomon were the first to build them, and their foundations were laid by others. A lady slaughtered a sheep with a stone and then the Prophet (ï·º) was asked about it and he permitted it to be eaten.
