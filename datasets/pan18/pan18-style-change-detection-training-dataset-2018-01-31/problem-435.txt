If you are discounting steel because it will rust then you are not caring for the bike properly. A properly maintained and stored steel bike should not rust. And for sure it should not rust out in your life time. You stated bikes from you fathers era lasted 40-50 years - pretty sure they were steel bikes. 

Don't do an insert - that is just what you do to get home. It will shift and wear out a tube in no time at all. 

If it is only rubbing lightly then no real harm riding it a few days if you are not riding it hard. 

There is a down side to not fixing the wheel if it is bent enough to rub the brake. 

If you want fatigue free and rust free then get titanium. 

Given the instructions from Surly are grease and not loctite I don't agree that loctite is the answer. Same with instructions from sram. Something is wrong for those to go loose in a day. 

All we know is your last aluminum, high quality, strong frame bike lasted about 10 years 

The best guess is your next aluminum, high quality, strong frame will also last 10 years Really that is the best guess 

For me I get a new tire and save that as an emergency spare. 

Another possible option if the cable has some length is to knot it around a bolt and bind it in one of the guides. There you have derailleur as a guide and you still have the front. 

Edit : Feeling ingenious - if you are lucky and the cable and outers can be reconfigured...... If you have a separate shifter, and the cable is broken close to the dérailleur, you could remove the shifter from the handle bars, and clamp/tape/cable tie it onto the seat post. Rearrange the cable outers, connect the cable back up to the dérailleur, giving you a full range of gears - although shifting won't be as easy. 

This will only work if the broken end is not too frayed. Remove the cable completely from the outers and the shifter. Thread the cable though the barrel adjuster on the dérailleur so that shifter end of the cable is butted against the adjuster. Clamp the cable onto the dérailleur (as you normally do, just with a very long tail) with the dérailleur in a compromise position (usually middle of cluster, but towards the big cogs if you have hills to climb, and little cogs if you have lots of flat ground.) Adjust dérailleur with the barrel till its sitting on the chosen cog. Cable tie/tape the remainder of the cable safely out the way (this is really important.....) - its unlikely you have have anything capable of cutting the cable so do not try. 

It is hard to wear out a single speed sprocket. Don't assume you need a new one.

There are a lot of question so I will settle on the one in the title.

Slime is lighter and conveniently pre-applied in the convenience of you own own home/garage. Slime tube sealant

Aluminum fatigues and steel does not fatigue. As stated in a comment steel does fatigue - well not always. Mild steel will not normally admit fatigue crack growth if the applied stresses are below about 10% of the strength of the material. Materials, such as aluminium alloys, do not have any such fatigue limit. If a cyclic load is applied, aluminium alloys will always fatigue. For the same strength a steel bike is typically going to be heavier than aluminum. But you get a bike that is much much less susceptible to fatigue. With steel you also get a bike that will take a ding (dent) and not compromise structural strength to the extent of aluminum. Not exactly the same thing but at the molecular level they are related.

Found a quoted number. Just because it was on the Internet does not make it right but here is a 5-10 year quote. Bike Frame: Aluminum Vs. Steel
