according to Jafari Fiqh if it is only Marriage proposal and does not contain other sin it is allowed. but Marriage proposal through parents of girl are recommended and direct Marriage proposal to girl is highly discouraged. about prayers in space I found this Istifta: we can not extend some rules without having evidence. each case should be studied separately with qualified scholars. The leather of the sofa at my friend’s home has some foreign characters printed on it; it has been imported from foreign countries, is this leather najis? Or since I suffer from waswasah, do you think this doubt of mine is just a result of that? ... And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.

The rest is for you to answer or check: Finally I would like to point at a chapter in the Regulation How it might be: I guess (and maybe i'm wrong) in most Islamic countries we don't have any regulatory agency or authority who checks the food. As for example i heard in Radio that Casablanca (Morocco) the official slaughterhouse can't afford the need of the local market many butchers slaughter in nonofficial abatoirs! And in many rural regions you won't find public authorities! My experience as a tourist in Egypt taught me it's better to eat at McDonalds or KFC than at al-Mu'min as we found some spoiled Seafood in our sandwich! So i hope i don't go to far if i said maybe McDonald as a global player will satisfy it's part rather than the local authorities (But Allah knows best)! For example you have in Surat an-Nissa' (4:11) the following expression: If for example you work for a company that deals with (riba) banks your income is halal. Well to answer your questions briefly: we can't. This fatwa also includes two ahadith from Musnad Ahmad saying which seem to be used in the context of wearing these verses such as if wearing an amulet, which indeed is a matter of shirk: In 5:4-5 you can read what is allowed for us and more exactly in 5:5 you'll find: Note that even in case of a Muslim slaughterer the animal could die from fear, or have a bad death if the person who is performing it was not experienced enough. This fatwa (I've only come across an Arabic fatwa) says: it is perfectly allowed for the son to get married before the end of the 'iddah of his mother and there's no harm for his mother to be present for the "wedding ceremony" if this doesn't mean that she would stay the night out of her home and she should avoid anything which is haram for a woman during her 'iddah like putting on perfume and beauty products etc. (also see in sahih Muslim and read this fatwa in English) An other basic rule says that anything which isn't clearly prohibited is allowed. From this point of view I'd say as long as you don't drink -by mistake- any kind of alcohol then using it for any other purpose should be allowed. In the following if I quote alcohol than the ruling should be considered the same for beer as well. So I will try to answer the redefined Question: Is using alcohol (especially beer) allowed, if we don't explicitly drink it? Eating pork is Haram in Islam and helping in a sin is prohibited in the holy Quran: http://makarem.ir/websites/english/ http://www.al-islam.org/laws/ http://moshavereh.porsemani.ir/content/%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87 also it causes: 1- daughter find a negative view about boy. 2- daughter should tell to her parents and her parents also find a negative view about boy. about prayers in space I found this Istifta: ...
