CCC 2094 One can sin against God's love in various ways: - indifference neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails to consider its prevenient goodness and denies its power. - ingratitude fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to return him love for love. - lukewarmness is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love; it can imply refusal to give oneself over to the prompting of charity. - acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from God and to be repelled by divine goodness. - hatred of God comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose goodness it denies, and whom it presumes to curse as the one who forbids sins and inflicts punishments. 

Beyond the Great Commission in Matthew -- which the Catholic Church accepts regardless of secular criticisms of that passage in Scripture -- the spreading of the Good News is the spreading of God's word. Going forth from the Apostolic age, anyone receiving the Good News is asked to make the leap of Faith, to trust God, to believe. The vignette about doubting Thomas emphasizes this, and it should be given due weight given that Jesus is the one issuing the rebuke to Thomas ... and through Thomas to any who doubt. 

Death entered the human condition. 

God communicated with Saul of Tarsus (Paul) in a particular way for His own reasons. God will speak to others in other ways to fulfill His purposes. Whether or not we are open to, or will listen to, the message is a different matter. Pride often gets in the way of listening to God. In brief, the view of the Roman Catholic Church: Continuing to follow the faith, however imperfectly, and being open to a spiritual awakening or a new understanding. God is reasonably patient with the motely variety of sinners who follow the Word become Flesh.
