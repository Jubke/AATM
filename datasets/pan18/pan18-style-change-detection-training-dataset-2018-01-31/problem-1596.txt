If the child is expected to eat the same dinner/participate in the same activity as the rest of the family, the choice option is still available. "Do you want this portion or this one?" "Do you want the green or the yellow bowl?" "Do you want to sit here or there?" "Do you want to have your turn before your sibling or before me*"? Choice can also be a redirection -- because the child in choosing believes they have already complied and in effect, are agreeing to eat the meal/participate . (*This sort of choice prevents always going first or last and makes it fair for other siblings/participants.) 

Pictures, photos, picture symbols, emotion boards (an area where the pictures show faces and the caregiver has discussed what each facial expression means.) When a child is happy -- the teacher can hold up the happy picture and tell the child, "You are happy." When the child is upset, "You are upset." The child is encouraged to show the teacher the symbol that represents how they feel and then the adult can help the child express it, understand it and perhaps help the child to feel better. 

LINK to how to teach positivity 

In a 'nutshell', the parent changes the subject and redirects the child's attention to another activity when possible. When it is not possible, redirection is a positive way to interact and help the child accomplish or act in the desired way. There are no idle threats or extra words added. We do not add that "You could break your leg/hurt your friend." It is possible to talk about those worries at other times, but not in the moment. (I am quoting my own material.) 

Then use the Choosing Language. "Which shirt do you want, the red or the blue?" When the child selects by pointing or even a word you respond, "You chose the red shirt. Good for you." This teaches that their choice was good, that this shirt is the red one and it teaches them/reinforces the choosing words.
