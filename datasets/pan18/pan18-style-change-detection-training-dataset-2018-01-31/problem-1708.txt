To say 1=1 does not express identity because there is a spatial difference between the left and right is confusing the thing with the symbol that denotes it. The number one is identical with itself. Of course a serious issue arises over how symbols denote things, and there is much debate over this. Frege held that names are a kind of abbreviated definite description, but this is only one of many accounts of the meaning of names. 

Frege, Quine, Geach and Dummett are all worth studying on this subject. The SEP article on identity is a helpful introduction. 

There are plenty of contexts (intensional contexts) in which identity relations appear to violate the indiscernibility of identicals. For example, "Mary knows that George Orwell wrote 1984" might be true, while "Mary knows that Eric Blair wrote 1984" might be false (even though George Orwell = Eric Blair). In general what this means is that while a given identity relation might correspond to a purely extensional equivalence in a particular logic, there might be a more expressive logic in which that identity relation is not extensional. 

Classically, there is no difference. Identity is a two place predicate which has the value true if its arguments are numerically identical and false otherwise. One can write such a predicate as Identical(x,y) or one can write it as x=y. The latter is just 'syntactic sugar' that makes sentences easier to read, but it expresses the same thing. This is the way identity is employed in logic, in particular in predicate logic, and by extension in mathematics. 

Creationism asserts something about the world that would explain our observations (it explains animal species by the hypothesis that God created animals as they are now some time ago). Similarly, string theory asserts something about the world that would explain our observations (that everything is constituted of strings at a fundamental level, which would explain all physical phenomena). This is a feature of scientific theories more generally: newtonian physics asserts that there are forces and masses to explain the movement of objects. The point of the demarcation problem is finding a criteria to sort out the assertions of this kind that can be called scientific or not. 

Second, it is possible to resist the view that all future events are determinate as a matter of logic. Your intuition is right that we cannot learn something about the world by pure a priori reasoning. This intuition can be implemented here by noting that determinateness of propositions is a linguistic principle (that all sentence have a truth value). The ontological counterpart would be: all objects have determinate properties. While the linguistic principle can be accepted a priori, its ontological counterpart can only be known by experience.

First it should be noted that we are not merely assigning classical probabilities to quantum particle positions, but complex numbers (and in composite systems, not only to individual positions, but to possible configurations of the whole system). Probabilities are calculated from the complex coefficient. That explains the interference pattern (different "possibilities" are "interacting" because of the way complex numbers add up) but if probabilities were assigned directly to the system, QM would loose most of its puzzling features.
