According to this perfectgame.org article, the answer is either Clay Condrey (94th round in 1996) or Travis Phelps (89th round in 1996), depending on whether the player was signed when he was drafted. 

The official scorer shall credit a pitcher with a save when such pitcher meets all four of the following conditions: 

If a runner is on third base and there's less than 2 outs, move your infielders in so that they have a chance to throw out the runner at home on a ground ball. (But if a runner is also on first base and there's one out, you would probably want to keep your infielders at double play depth so they can try to turn a double play on a ground ball.) 

under "Select Additional Criteria Games Must Match", add a criteria for "HR >= 1" (b) He is not the winning pitcher; If a runner is on first base, keep your first baseman on the bag to allow for pickoff attempts. This will prevent the runner from having a huge lead making it easier to steal second base. This is something that both Sanders and Jackson shared, both were very good at both sports to the extent that teams were willing to let them do both even though they had to sacrifice a roster spot to a player who would not be there 100% of the time. It's a long road to get from the draft to the major leagues, excellent players often shortcut one or many levels of their team's farm system, but most players play for at least part of one season in the minor leagues (the last player to go straight to the bigs from the draft was Mike Leake in Cincinnati a couple of years ago) Second, a Perfecto requires that the pitcher retire every batter in the game. That means if the game goes 10 or longer, he must stay in the game in order to get credit for it being a perfect game.
