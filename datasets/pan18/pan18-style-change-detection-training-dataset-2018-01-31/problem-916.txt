I use the name "Popular Demand" here on Meta, but everywhere else I'm "Lord Torgamus." (Fun fact: neither one of these is the name on my birth certificate!) I just visited stackexchange.com and was surprised to see both names there, in different places. I'm not sure that this is a bug, or how it could really affect anything, but it seemed weird enough that I figured it was worth reporting. Screenshot: Chat user card layouts can't handle the situation where a user has a double-digit number of gold badges and triple-digit numbers of silver and bronze badges (or any number of badges totaling eight digits). I just looked over your rep graph and saw only 49 days on which you earned 200 or more reputation from vote-type sources. You're one short. I know this may actually already be accounted for in the code, and therefore not a bug, but I couldn't find documentation and I was curious. Supporting evidence for March 25 not counting: you didn't get the Mortarboard badge that day. You did get it on April 1, the first time you reached 200 rep in one day without the association bonus. Clearly, this is your punishment for participating in a joke proposal. Remember the First Rule of Stack Exchange: On March 25, you went over 200 only because of the account association bonus, which isn't a vote and therefore doesn't count for the badge. On April 24, you hit exactly 200, but eight points came from suggested edits to tag wikis, which are also not votes and therefore also do not count for the badge. Your count of 51 included both of these days. According to the badges page, the requirements for Yearling are: EDIT 2: It seems that if ignored users leave a room for long enough to drop out of the "users in room" list and later come back, their avatars in the "people in room" list return to full size.
