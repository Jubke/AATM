Can we interpret from the Holy Quran, the earth is flat or it is round or it simply shed no light on it. 

In the holy Quran, Quran is mentioned numerous time as the book 

And after that He spread the earth; 

Many searchers say Islams give the concept of flat earth which is contrary to what it is. 

among many others. I have also come across Muslim brothers who believe the mountains act as pegs so that earth can not move. Is this a correct interpretation from Quran? 

In the last sermon of the prophet, the prophet said 

But Quran was never compiled as book in the life of Muhammad (PBUH). Why was it left out of the book form when the Quran itself refer to it as a book? 

This question is not related to these two verses only. These are just for reference. 

Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of black muddy (or hot) water. And he found near it a people. We (Allâh) said (by inspiration): "O Dhul-Qarnain! Either you punish them, or treat them with kindness." 

In a Hadith Imam Sadiq a.s. said to one of his companions: 

Because this question of angels means that other humans lived before Adam a.s. on earth unless they did not asked such question. 

Firstly Quran itself is the miracle of our times and contains many scientific miracles. but if one is not aware about the context of society at 1400 years ago in Arabia peninsula when Quran was appeared, it is not easy to understand how Quran is miracle of this era. there are different websites explaining some scientific miracles of Quran. 

By using Tawassul one can see the miracle by his own eyes. Tawassul is the best way for seeing a miracle. for example healing of one who doctors can not heal him. 

Perhaps you think Allah (AWJ) created only this universe and created no humans unless you?! Yes, By Allah Indeed God created thousands of thousands of universes and thousands of thousands of Adams that you are at the end of those universes and Adams.

According to Shia Islam the exact age of Earth is not mentioned but there are some Hadith that show the age of earth is millions or billions of years. 

This list is only few examples (like a drop from an ocean). nearly every Iranian has miraculous experiences from Imam Reza a.s. for himself or his relatives. Iranians love Imam Reza a.s. too much. many of people have seen him in dream that he answers to their questions and problems. this is not only about him but about all of the fourteen infallibles. but because the shrine of 8th Imam is inside Iran and easier to access people of Iran go to his shrine and do Tawassul to him. Tawassul means asking one of Awlia to he ask God to God accept our dua. because our sins make a barrier between us and God and causes our dua do not reach God and so not be accepted. people from all over the world come to holy shrine of Imam Reza a.s. and seek Tawassul from his holy soul.
