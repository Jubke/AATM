Similarly, a legislature is usually considered to be an organ of the government rather than an entity in its own right that can be sued for money damages or injunctive relief, in most cases. Instead, it has governmental immunity from lawsuits. 

In this context what Bannon means is that the United States is, or should be, a "nation" that is a cultural community of people who share a national identity. There are also different levels of classification - and a determination that information is not classified at one level does not mean that it ceases to be classified at a lower level. Disclosure to someone with a lower level security clearance than the document revealed, while prohibited, is a different matter than disclosing a classified document to the general public. Non-citizens who do not have green cards must generally pay out of state tuition at colleges and universities, although some states allow undocumented immigrants who are domiciled in their state to pay in state tuition.

Historically, alcoholic beverages have not had a very complicated set of ingredients and those ingredients are usually strongly (although not completely) determined by the name, so ingredient labelling has historically not been a big concern. For example, in order to call liquor "bourbon", at least 50% of the alcohol content must be derived from corn derived alcohol that is distilled and then aged for a certain period of time set forth in the regulations. 

(1) Members of a regular component of the armed forces, including those awaiting discharge after expiration of their terms of enlistment; volunteers from the time of their muster or acceptance into the armed forces; inductees from the time of their actual induction into the armed forces; and other persons lawfully called or ordered into, or to duty in or for training in, the armed forces, from the dates when they are required by the terms of the call or order to obey it. Also, the law does recognize the concept of a limited disclosure of classified information that does not per se cause that information to be declassified.

For example, a statement that gun control saves lives (or does not save lives) involves cause and effect determinations in highly complex social science contexts where there could be hidden causes or misunderstood relationships. Given that the courts and government don't necessarily have a superior ability to sort of the truth of statements like these, these kinds of statements are given special protections from legal liability for being false. 

In England the protection against double jeopardy was considered a universal maxim of the common law and was embraced by eminent jurists Henry de Bracton (1250), Sir Edward Coke (1628), Sir Matthew Hale (1736), and Sir William Blackstone (1769). However, the English double jeopardy doctrine was extremely narrow. It afforded protection only to defendants accused of capital felonies and applied only after conviction or acquittal. It did not apply to cases dismissed prior to final judgment and was not immune to flagrant abuse by the British Crown. 

Racism and Xenophobia Racism is one motive often ascribed to the NRA and its supporters, either in the form of indifference to the desire of minorities in high crime neighborhoods to be free from fear, as in this New York Times op-ed, and also based upon their apparent indifferent response to disregard of Second Amendment rights when the disregard implicates a minority member (according to the Huffington Post). 

Similarly, to be called "wine" a product must be derived from fermented grapes, and to be called "brandy" a product must be derived from the distillation of wine. Another defined term is "malt liquor" (which is a form of beer with added alcohol). "Gin" must be derived according to regulatory specifications from juniper berries. Voters directly elect members of the House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, and also directly elect members of the electoral college who in turn elect the U.S. President. Most laws are adopted by Congress with the signature of the President or by overriding a Presidential veto. Some appointments are made by the President and approved by the U.S. Senate. Treaties are made by the President and approved by a two-thirds majority of the U.S. Senate. Impeachment is done by the U.S. House by majority vote and approved by a two-thirds vote of the U.S. Senate.
