After narrating the story of Companions of the Cave in the Qur'an, God rebukes those who attempt to guess at al-Ghaib. Arguing about the details about any such story, including details such as whether it's authentic or fabricated, is futile unless clear evidence is available. How unbelievable and fantastical it may appear is irrelevant. Belief in al-Ghaib includes believing in things that are otherwise unexplainable by science or observation. 

It's always nice to know that there were no pig carcasses involved in the production of your water, but I would call the certification overkill in this case. The best one can do would be to apply the advice presented in the hadith of God's pasture: by only narrating those stories which are clearly permissible (such as those in the Qur'an, those authentically narrated by the prophet, or those from the children of Israel) and avoiding all others, one can be sure they're not transgressing God's own limits, even if by accident. The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist, and that has been made unlawful to the believers. 

Regarding Magians, its the consensus of the ulema, except for a group which dissented, that their slaughtered will not be eaten nor will they be married, because the majority view of the scholars is that they are not people of the book. Nikah here means intercourse and the purpose of the verse is to denounce fornication rather than to establish legality of a marriage i.e it means one who has intercourse with an immoral person is themselves immoral, and that both partners are equally sinful ... one who has intercourse with a prostitute is as sinful as the prostitute. So if a parent or ruler is to forbid you from doing a permissible (not obligatory) act X, you are under an obligation to refrain from it. Act X is not itself made haram, but you sin if you do it.
