Which means that you can change presentation without touching the data, or apply the presentation to multiple types of data. This is exactly what technologies like CSS and XHTML together achieve. Of course Semantic HTML is not necessary for this decoupling, but provides for by being semantic it enforces exclusion of presentational information. source: http://bytesizecss.com/blog/post/fix-haslayout-with-one-line-of-css You need to add a dot (.) at last selector: Is there any use of favicon.ico for mobile websites? will it be shown in browser address bar and tabs in mobile websites http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/ArticleGoogleChromeCompatFAQ This is built by Free css dropdown menu framework http://www.lwis.net/free-css-drop-down-menu/ http://www.xstandard.com/en/articles/wysiwyg-editors-and-bad-markup/ I know it's HTML5 but is there any advantage of using it until non HTML5 supported browsers are still in use. before - http://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/test/before.html http://www.punkchip.com/2007/02/css-deprecated-attributes-2/ http://jquery.lukelutman.com/plugins/pseudo/ using DXImageTransform filter for Microsoft Internet Explorer using Canvas object for other browsers The library has been tested with: http://www.tomjewett.com/accessibility/508-eval-tools.html I found this editor useful. all available HTML elemnts in this Editor can be styled http://www.seoblogger.co.uk/serps/the-benefits-of-using-semantic-code.html http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:_7_eRIBRrhoJ:www.nealgrosskopf.com/tech/thread.php%3Fpid%3D60+http://www.nealgrosskopf.com/tech/thread.php%3Fpid%3D60&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=firefox-a The two points mentioned earlier are the basic benefits of using semantic code. If we use globally known tags, others understand without any additional effort. Any software program that uses the globally known tags will not be able to understand our page. Which is more semantic and valid? In Microsoft Internet Explorer, select Tools -> Internet Options... -> Accessibility... and check the "Format documents using my style sheets" box. Using the Browse button, open the lowvis.css style sheet from wherever you stored it, and click OK to both the Accessibility and the Internet Options panels.
