He's meditating on God's actions and word, but he's still asking God to teach him. He's marveling, wondering, thinking upon the truths of God's covenant with him and Israel, but he certainly doesn't have it figured out. 

A few verses down David implores God: 

How to stop trying to figure it all out This borders on a pastoral concern, naturally, but I think we can take cues from the verses cited above. In my experience a good attitude is to 

Also, we're going to be in heaven for eternity learning about God. If it takes an eternity to learn about God, don't worry that you don't understand it all right now. 

Additionally, the Bible talks numerous times of the mystery of God's nature and plan... 

Also, by technical definition, contemplate does not mean comprehend 

The Psalms are a great place to go for this. Psalm 143:5 says 

Try to remember I can't figure it out. This is hard, because it's a fundamentally different from the narcissistic mindset we naturally have. You have to start knowing that no matter how hard you or anyone else tries, you won't figure it all out. Try to figure out as much as possible anyways. We're supposed to learn about God (how can you worship someone you don't even know?). When you hit a paradox, stop. When you encounter something that the Bible doesn't explain, don't try to reason it out. The Bible leaves it alone for a reason. Don't try to compress the Trinity into the phases of water; the analogy fails miserably. (though it can be a helpful illustration). Paradoxes are there both because God is greater than us and to remind us of that. 

The Bishop admitted, "Truly, I do not know. I wish to understand what we can control and what we cannot, and how God foresaw one and foreordained the other." 

Yes, you're absolutely right! Jesus never broke any bones. That's a fulfillment of the prophecy from Old Testament and it's written about in John. 

This also echos the Leviticus scripture showing that God finds homosexuality detestable. 

However, as @Ollie Jones mentioned, the Old Testament for this is based on the Septuagint--an ancient Greek translation--rather than the original Hebrew. Because of that, it's not quite as reliable as going straight to the source. (In some situations it can be quite a ways off.) 

God gave us free will. He allows us to follow or turn away from him. God knows what we will do. However, we have the power to control our responses. If God forced our hand, we would not have free will! 

"How can that be?" objected Theodosius. "Did God foreknow and actually foreordain our deeds from eternity?" 

3 In the New Testament, there is Romans 1:26-27 

God allows us to either reap the benefits of following him or suffer the consequences of turning away form him. He knows beforehand what we will do, but we don't. So, he allows us to fail or succeed for our benefit. 

The prophecy that John refers to is found in Psalms 34:20: 

It's really not a denominational issue, per se, but a doctrinal issue or a simple preference. 

These verses clearly state that Sodom was destroyed because of they were haughty and did detestable things. While Ezekiel isn't clear which detestable things were done, the Genesis account only indicates rampant homosexuality (possibly alluding to public, homosexual orgies) as the cause for this phrase "detestable things". 

An interesting (old) story about this: 

Those were the regulations for the lamb that was slain for the passover feast. There are many passages that relate Jesus to the passover lamb. This lack of broken bones is one of these connections. (This regulation can also be seen in Numbers 9:12.) 

St. Maximus ca. 580-662 a.d. (The Life of Our Holy Monastic Father Maximus the Confessor and Martyr) 

The venerable Maximus explained, "We do not directly control whether blessings will be showered upon us or chastisements will befall us, but our good and evil deeds most certainly depend on our will. It is not ours to choose whether we are in health or sickness, but we make determinations likely to lead to one or the other. Similarly, we cannot simply decide that we shall attain the kingdom of heaven or be plunged into the fire of Gehenna, but we can will to keep the commandments or transgress them."
