Which just happens to be 15 characters... with the period. 

So, my feature-request is that we get more granular search options for score. 

I would expect it to give all the negatively scored posts - there is a minus sign in there. 

When you submit your question, Stack Exchange automatically strips out ending periods - which is why the current title is only 14 characters. 

I am a 1500* high rep SO user. As such, I've had the Retag ability for some time, but I'm not yet able to bypass the review queue for 'normal' edits. 

Upovoting? New feature? Does it refer to the action of upvoting a post when a unicorn is in your backyard eating a waffle? 

* I've crossed 2k, and now I have the unified Edit menu you're all missing out on! 

The Edit option already knows when you are only performing a Retag - and it pops up an annoying message like "use the Retag option instead". If it's already that smart, why can't it automatically reroute the retag through to the right action? - and have them instantly applied, just like the old Retag option would. 

After going through posts in the /review page, one of the trends that I noticed was that very few non-answers were upvoted at all. Now that results are presented in random groupings if a query has more than a certain number of results, there isn't a way to sort these results by votes or by those which perform worst on the review algorithm. 

If we had an option on the /review page to filter the low quality posts to only those at 0 votes or lower, I think it would make the random groupings more effective in showing potential answers to be removed, as well as questions that may need help. 

A lot of short but good answers are now popping up in the low quality posts tab's random groupings, which is making it harder to find true non-answers. Almost all of the upvoted answers that appear here are actual answers and should be left alone. Very few of the non-answers get voted up by anyone, because of their lack of content.
