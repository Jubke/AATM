Is it realistic to just stop giving the bottle one day? Or should the daily amount be reduced over a two weeks until nothing is left? Or should we replace it with water? 

He knows it's part of the bedtime routine and doesn't try to avoid it. He will happily grab and hold out his toothbrush for us to put toothpaste on it, and then he enjoys sucking and chewing it. 

Sometimes we send our toddler son to his room, either to calm down or because he has misbehaved and we need some distance. Our aim is not primarily the punishment, but rather to have him calm down and/or get him out of our way. This works well and usually everything is fine 3-5 minutes later. 

I'm sure the headline made you curious? :-) But I'm serious, and I am not referring to toys but actual household machines. We have a Roomba floor vacuum cleaner and a lawn mower. 

But studies suggest (see references below) that children don't learn well on their own from a screen. What's lacking is the interaction and the actual presence of a real human -- and for language learning, it must be a native speaker. I imagine that when the effect of live human interaction is so profound compared to video, then books must really suck. 

We don't believe in physical punishment (spanking etc.). We do believe that our son clearly understands what we tell him, and when he's not alone with mom, he demonstrates that he clearly understands the rules that exist. 

My family just +1'd itself. The newborn sleeps with us in the master bedroom for now, but we will move him when he's a few months old and no longer requires attention several times each night. Our plan is to let him share a bedroom with his brother who is 3 years older. 

Please note that my context for this answer is that an iPhone/iPad/laptop is an expensive piece of equipment that I can't afford to replace on a whim. I'm sure suitably affluent parents have other/higher limits, but my limit is lower. I'm less strict concerning less valuable non-toys.
