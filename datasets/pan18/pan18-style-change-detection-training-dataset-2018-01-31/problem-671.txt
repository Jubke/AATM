Just outs to improve on the next card is fairly straight forward. Probability to win is much more complex. If it is just you against a single player on the river then you can calculate. A starting hand against 3 random hands is very complex. 

if they bet the pot then leave 

Micro stakes on line for practice? There are lots of books. 

Give them a chance to re-raise you back in case they have a real hand like KK so you can get it all in. I have read never slow play the nuts as your opponent might have a hand willing to come along. 

That is a value bet if they had a pair or better and were protecting from the flush. A better bet is actuality 1/2 the pot as you probably would have chased that also getting 2:1 thinking you would get a free river. 

Let say you played 89 suited and totally miss the flop. Decide the range of hands you want to represent. Bet enough to try and take down the pot right then. Or put in a value bet to make your later bluff believable. You may need to fire three times at the bluff. 

Based on hand independent it is 0.000256 (quad) * 0.0017 (boat) = 0.00000044 

78s plays better at a big table than heads up. 

With 1 1/2 bb in the pot then even a 3 bb bet only has to get a fold 2/3 of the time. Even when you do get looked up two under cards to an over pair is 6:1. Should be raising air (non-value) like 1/3 the time and then go up or down based on how often you are getting called. Bluffs don't need to pay for themselves outright as they are a tool to get action when you do have a hand. 

At 8 I think it is 0.4114 Or 1.4306 : 1 This is for exactly one ace out - (not two) 

Hero needs to pick of 7 of 12 binds at as minimum If the maximum buff rate is < 1/2 then need 4 good hands AKQJ The best card you can give the villain is T 

4:1 then yes call as you are getting immediate odd Less than 2:1 then NO as you are not even getting odds for 2 cards 

Old school Harrington on Hold'em, Volume II: The Endgame covers tournament strategy and math nicely. 

By only betting 1/3 the pot on the flop villain actually had a negative EV if the plan was to take down a blank on the turn 600 versus 590. 

Book recommendations are kind of out of scope. 

Players like Negreanu will play a range of hands and go for pot control. He has some books out. 

Add them for 1 or 2 aces out = 0.4857 

I have seen it on TV a few times 

Ace high straight is highest but it is actually easier to make because there are no blockers above. 

Highest or lower boat is immaterial. Quads beat a full house. 

Order of the cards does not matter in poker and you don't play the whole deck 

I like : odds turn 4:1 turn plus river 2:1 

Ace little is just not that strong. You only want to play it late and cheap in multiplayer pots. You are only going to make a flush by the river 1:16. And if you pair you ace you can easily get yourself in trouble. A lot of people will say mid suited connectors are better to play than ace little suited. 

Don't bluff with total dogs unless you have a read they will fold. A hand like 53s rather than 72o. Give yourself a chance at a call and miracle flop to stack them. 

Put villain in worse reasonable spot. They are in the SB and get raised 10BB. How often can villain be bluffed and have no value in calling. 

Also make sure you have a player capable of laying down a hand. You get some poor players that just don't lay down hands. And you get some poor players that lay down too easily. 

Bet 1/2 the pot and get a call on the flop - pot is now 1600 If a blank hits bet 1/2 the pot again and take it down on the turn EV = -400 + (1 - 9/43)1600 = 865 865 > 800 If villain had a single of the suit and took your outs to 8 then 902 

Another important dynamic is that preflop the button is first to act and post flop the button is last to act. So you would naturally play a wider range as last to act postflop. If the button just folds pre-flop then you are giving up position. The button is also the small blind so cannot check the initial bet - to call the BB the dealer must put out an (additional) sb. Button should raise a lot to steal the BB just like you would from the cutoff. If you have a value hand you should raise for value. If you are bluffing then you have to raise. Open value hands the same as a bluff or they can read you like a children's book. Have a standard raise - like 3 bb. If you are going to just call open some times then do so with both value and bluff hands at an equal frequency.
