As you correctly state, the original meaning of the terms nothing is to negate a positive statement. But many languages allow the linguistic possibility to make a noun from words and to form the noun nothing. But the noun nothing is not a noun like other nouns, there is no object to show saying: This object is nothing. In most cases an atheist will deny that life has a meaning by itself. Instead it is the task of each individual to give an individual meaning to his own life. In my opinion, Aristotle is right in this historical assessment. But a modern point of view criticizes that it is not meaningful to pose all questions for every object, e.g. it is not meaningful to ask for the causa finalis of inanimate objects. Aristotle did no know about microcosmos. Concerning macrocosmos he had only a theoretical - and wrong - conception. Aristotle gives in Metaphysics a history of philosophy. He emphasizes that his forerunners detected only fractions of the different types of cause (aition). Hence he considers his doctrine of 4 causes a progress in philosophy. The new founded order of Jesuits united the main proponents of scholastic philosophy. The subject was teached in an authoritative form, relying heavily on Thomas Aquinas and on the works of Aristotle. It was used as a safeguard to support and to defend the doctrines of the Catholic church. We know about internal instructions to the philosophical teachers of this order. They should avoid introducing new thoughts and even new philosophical methods. The problem of freewill results from the fact that our subjective experiences from the first persons's viewpoint are different than our scientific observations and experiences from the third person's viewpoint. Aristotle states that asking these four questions is more powerful and prompts a more comprehensive answer than the partial aspects considered by his forerunners.
