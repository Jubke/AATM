For sure there are more eyes on your question, especially if there are users who are notified for new questions using the tags they are following, or who can get a list of questions using specific tags. 

Setting a synonym tag doesn't mean to consider it correct; quite the opposite, it means to mark the synonym tag as less preferable or not correct. I think you misunderstood the purpose of synonym tags. When a tag is set as synonym of another tag, the first tag is replaced by the second tag in all the questions where the tag is used. In your case, if you use sqllite in a question, when you save the question you are asking, you will notice that the question is being tagged sqlite. In this case, the tag has been probably created because enough users kept to misspell the tag as sqllite. The problem is with users who can create new tags, and who would create a new separate tag all times they misspell sqlite, if sqllite were not a synonym tag. Clearly, the edit needs to be appropriate: You should not remove part of the question because you are not able to answer that part, or change (for example) the tags to exclude c, and include c# simply because you know the answer for C#, but not for C. That is valid also in the case you are not going to answer the question, though. 

The excerpt for featured used in this meta site is the following: This is similar to the extensions introduced in Objective-C from Apple compilers: Questions about those extensions are still tagged objective-c. 

huge is used when the question is about something extremely large. It doesn't seem relevant, except for mathematic about large numbers, but for that there is already biginteger. Only 20k users can edit any tag wiki present in a site; in that case, the tag wiki is not first created by Communityâ™¦.
