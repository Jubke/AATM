To say 1=1 does not express identity because there is a spatial difference between the left and right is confusing the thing with the symbol that denotes it. The number one is identical with itself. Of course a serious issue arises over how symbols denote things, and there is much debate over this. Frege held that names are a kind of abbreviated definite description, but this is only one of many accounts of the meaning of names. 

Classically, there is no difference. Identity is a two place predicate which has the value true if its arguments are numerically identical and false otherwise. One can write such a predicate as Identical(x,y) or one can write it as x=y. The latter is just 'syntactic sugar' that makes sentences easier to read, but it expresses the same thing. This is the way identity is employed in logic, in particular in predicate logic, and by extension in mathematics. 

There are plenty of contexts (intensional contexts) in which identity relations appear to violate the indiscernibility of identicals. For example, "Mary knows that George Orwell wrote 1984" might be true, while "Mary knows that Eric Blair wrote 1984" might be false (even though George Orwell = Eric Blair). In general what this means is that while a given identity relation might correspond to a purely extensional equivalence in a particular logic, there might be a more expressive logic in which that identity relation is not extensional. 

I do not understand the grey above, but do understand all else. 

So without computers, from given premises (that may be long and convoluted), how can you conjecture, before deducing, the conclusion yourself? One must at least conjecture a conclusion before attempting any deduction or (dis)proof.

I already understand and so ask not about the quote above. 1. How can a FP still constitute a SIA? 

[4.] Why can only IND determine END? Eg: an IND for a cat may not resolve unclear and vague cases; eg, some strange felid hybrid may match all your attributes, but may still not be a cat.

The principle that intension determines extension, whereas the converse is not true, underlies the fact that 

The above does not appear fallacious, and instead appears to lack only a Suppressed Premise, which (when revealed) would validate the argument. What have I neglected? 

The function of a precising definition is to clarify a vague word, and vagueness is a problem affecting intensional meaning. Because the intension is imprecise, the extension is indefinite. To attempt to render the intension precise by exactly specifying the extension (as with an extensional definition) would be tantamount to

Frege, Quine, Geach and Dummett are all worth studying on this subject. The SEP article on identity is a helpful introduction.

In the 2 Logic textbooks read (the above and Hurley's), from the given premises, no exercise will ask you to determine the conclusion yourself; instead the textbook divulges the conclusion and then asks you to deduce it. But this is irrealistic; real life, one must determine conclusions oneself.
