StrixVarias Answer is Correct. You let the turret survive to deny creeps to the enemy. However it's important to notice that this is not appropriate in every situation and especially in soloqueue you should take it down more often. It's important to know when to kill or leave a turret. Only the outer turrets should be left alive when you have the option to kill them 

First of all we have to keep in mind: The tier list is not perfect It's actually just a list written by pro players based on statistics and personal experience. Also if you only play God-Tier champions in soloqueue you won't jump from bronze to diamond in one day. This list only describes the potential of a perfectly played champion and not the percentage of games actually won by this champion (If you want plain statistics check out op.gg). Of course this also means that certain champions that might be really strong most of the time can be absolutely useless against a special teamcomp.

No! Caitlyn has a higher range than you and janna can disengage pretty easily. Also her shield will negate a huge part of the damage you deal to any of those two and she can push the turret even harder due to the bonus AD of the shield. In a matchup like this it would be better to just freeze the lane. You can still initiate if you have to but you won't lose a turret. Also if you position yourself right you won't get ganked that easily and in addition to that you can ward the bush to watch out for lane ganks. If you turn it around blue Tahm swallows red Jinx. Blue Tahm then gets swallowed by Red Tahm. in this case Red Jinx will leave before blue Tahm. 

In this video you can see a "Tahm Kench-ception" As you can see the ones that got eaten first will leave, regardless of how deep they are in.
