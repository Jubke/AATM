Conclusion The bottom line is that at the federal level, where a "race to the bottom" isn't possible, there are rather pervasive requirements for entities to disclose beneficial ownership to someone or other, usually for either tax purposes or securities market regulation purposes. 

There are about 37.3 million businesses and trusts in the United States. All but about 303,000 trusts and about 1.6 million C corporations don't have to report their beneficial ownership to the IRS in years when they make no distributions to their beneficial owners, the lion's share of the C corporations economically are publicly held companies that have to make disclosures anyway, and the lion's share of the privately held C corporations aren't making distributions to shareholders because they are making distributions to employee-shareholders who are disclosed to the IRS in their capacity as employees. 

Disclosures Of Ownership For Federal Tax Purposes For federal income tax purposes, (1) all owners of entities organized as single member LLCs, (2) all entities taxed as partnerships under Subchapter K of Title 26 (the Internal Revenue Code) such as general partnerships, limited partnerships, and if they do not elect to be taxed as corporations: limited liability partnerships, limited liability limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited partnership associations, (3) all entities taxed as corporations which make elections under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, (4) all grantor trusts, (5) all simple trusts, (6) all complex trusts that make distributions to beneficiaries, (7) all private foundations, (8) all REITs, (9) all mutual funds, and (10) a C-corporations that pay dividends in a given year, must disclose their owners/beneficiaries to the IRS in connection with their annual information tax return requirements. 

Pretty much the only entities that do not have to report their owners to the IRS are (1) complex trusts that distribute nothing to beneficiaries in the current year, and (2) C-corporations that do not pay dividends in a given year. 

For example, 82.2% of corporations that owed any corporate income taxes owed just 0.6% of corporate income taxes owed, and 93.5% of corporations that owed any corporate income taxes owed less than 2% of all corporate income taxes. Meanwhile, fewer than 40,000 corporations (at least a third of which, if not more, are publicly held) owe 98.8% of all corporate income taxes, despite being just 0.6% of all corporations. 

The phrase is intended, in part, to evoke the more moderate connotations of the notion of civic nationalism, while actually really referring to something else. Self-described of the Alt-Right, such as Emile Durand, for example, has embraced ethnic or racial nationalism as a natural outgrowth of the milder civic nationalism and have interpreted Bannon's turn of phrase in that interview as an expression of support for racial nationalism. 

The phrase is also responsive to world views such as those of Frank Gaffney Jr., a good friend of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who stated the following views about Muslims in an interview: 

In 2014, in the U.S., there were 303,000 complex trusts that didn't have to report their beneficiaries to the IRS because they made no distributions in the current year out of 3,171,000 trusts and estate in all (rounding to the nearest 1000) and some of those had to report beneficiaries in prior years when distributions were made by those trusts to beneficiaries. 

In this context what Bannon means is that the United States is, or should be, a "nation" that is a cultural community of people who share a national identity. 

On the other hand, others in the Alt-Right movement see the phrase "civic society" as a sincere effort to evoke mere "civic nationalism" when only racially based nationalism will do, rather than as a dog whistle.
