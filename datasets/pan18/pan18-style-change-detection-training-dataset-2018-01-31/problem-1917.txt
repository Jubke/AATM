Life is a cart pulled by dogs; you, as a dog, have a choice between struggling against it, thereby causing yourself grief, or simply running along, going neither too fast nor too slowly 

Any sexual escapade or other enjoyment compromised one's apatheia. In addition, even moderate pleasure could destabilize the soul, subjecting it to greater pleasure by consequence, which would ultimately end in pain. There are some similarities to Buddhism. 

Because moderate pleasure did not compromise ataraxia, casual sex and good food were allowed. But falling in love and unhealthy gluttony led to pain and were anathema. 

The Stoics practised apatheia, "absence of feeling": a state of mind where the soul experiences no emotion at all. That was the only way in which the soul could be completely free. Any emotion would bind it to the body. 

Epicureans strove after ataraxia, "unperturbedness" of the soul: a state of mind where neither pain nor pleasure affected the soul too much. This was the highest "pleasure". 

First it must be said that hedonism in the modern sense was not the core of Epicurism: Epicurus used the word ἡδονή (hêdonê, "pleasure") in a less obvious sense. 

Mild pain and mild pleasure were acceptable; but great pleasure was ill advised, because it would eventually end, and thus lead to longing for more, which constitutes pain. When we long for something, our heart aches. 

That which provokes our pity (one could say here, the pitiful; but one shouldn't because its sense is no longer consonant with that which provokes pity; but like the word pathetic, which was originally meant that which had pathos; now both are close to meaning that which deserves our contempt; this movement in emotional value is of significance itself; but I digress) according to Aristotle, is the emotion proper to tragedy; hence he says: 

How do I connect the the philosophy to the literary here? 

Having said this, a certain theological position identifies God with Logos - reason. This seems as wrong-headed as the purely rational alien. If God exists - then he is far more mysterious than some rule-enacting bureaucract. 

If it was painful or destructive, in a proper sense, then it would be a species of Horror; and this would jar against the good humour of comedy. 

It's a complex problem as to what constitutes the legitimacy of sovereignty; a possible route into this are Hobbes analysis of the various powers of sovereignty, and Lockes notion of the social contract - there's also the Confucian/Daoist notion of the Mandate of Heaven. 

After all, if Nietschze was correct, then in todays post-christian & secular western europe slave-morality should have withered away, but though it is no longer culturally espoused, the rebel being an iconic figure, as opposed to the saint, it seems to me practically this is still the real morality, for example, espoused by governments & corporations. 

Up until this point Rawls had analysed the institutions of society and not individuals; he will now go on to discuss Justice for inividuals but before doing so he commits himself to not discussing the 'natural assets' - that is the talents of a man - seeing them fixed; he won't discuss in depth the possibility of change; this of course is known as Eugenics, and Rawls will have known its implication in the Holocaust (as described by Hannah Arendt in her densely detailed book - Totalitarianism - the science of eugenics was widespread on both sides of the Atlantic); and this is the reason for his silence; his intellectual honesty pushes him to note however that:

He means that it reveals the crudeness of both the audience and the comedian; but there are degrees of comedy; he notes for example comedy in Homer - whichis an epic. 

This actually makes more sense to me, especially 'absurdism'. 

Arrows impossibility theorem states:

One notices a threefold expansion of the transitoriness or impermanence from life, to society to the world. One of the principal practices is to control dukkha. 

Indeed can language induce neuroses? One could imagine several interesting but unethical experiments to test this proposition. 

Surely ethics if it is mean anything substantial must be grounded in the human situation? Kants categorical imperative is often used as purely rational impersonal characterisation of how to solve ethical dilemmas. But this seems to be wrong-headed seeing that he declared a 'copernican revolution' where objects of the world conform to the human situation. It appears a certain element of his system has been plucked out without due consideration as to the reasons which led him there.
