As the chain and cassette wear they just don't grip each other as well. Under higher force the chain can jump. 

Yes they are both chains but that is about all they have in common. It is a bar lube. 

If you have front derailleur then using the bigger ring there will let you use bigger cogs in the rear. If I can be in 3 or higher in the rear on the big ring up front then I use the big ring up front to keep miles off the smaller cogs in back. 

If this is a dup sorry. I will delete. 

Cannot tell anything about the larger chain ring but the small chain ring is not in bad shape. 

And that valve stem might be leaning a bit. Probably not enough to matter but ideally it is straight. 

Most likely your derailleur will not take the entire range so you have to stay away from big big and stay away from small small. 

What do I need to know to buy new chainrings for my crankset? 

With cassette and chainrings you will have a maximum hi to lo range based on the derailleur. If you stay close to what you have now you should be good. Check the chainring for wear. You may not have worn them all out. 

Sounds like you have multi-speed cassette, no derailleur, and no chain tensioner. On the 18T you have good chain tension. Even in this set up as the chain stretches you will get slack on the 18T. 

The first tool you need is chain lube. 

Below is a SRAM with a reusable PowerLock on the left. The picture is 14 links. This chain is packaged as 114 links. You will typically cut the chain down and save the spare links for repair. Rather than count I just lay the old chain down next to the new. There is going to be some stretch so you may need to adjust to match up links (or pins/rollers). 

Are all of those pictures in the same gear? Big in front and 4th in rear?
