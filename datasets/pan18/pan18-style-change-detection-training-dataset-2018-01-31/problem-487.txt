In cases like this, should I simplify the words so that a 10 years old kid can understand the novel? Should I give practical examples? Or connect that idea to the characters? The test of people: Post your story online. Did people like it? Did they use words like impressive, funny, or awesome? If the answer is yes, publish it. Share your amazing story to the world. So I tend to write this instead: I accepted that a novel can never be perfect. As the saying goes: "You write a novel when you don't know what you want to say or how you want to say it."

Now to answer your questions, starting a paragraph in a non-straight way can add spice or other connotation to the paragraph. Of course, doing it too much would just confuse the reader. This is the beginning of a short story I'm writing: I thought it would be nice to give the reader a break from the main plot (and explore the characters a bit more). Or maybe I should leave these chapters out? (Sometimes I think that I should just accept my fate as writer that only writes short stories. Or just write novels that are composed of interconnected short stories, like David Mitchell's Ghostwritten.) In brief, make use of senses, metaphors, and surroundings to reveal the character's emotions or thoughts. Ling shook her head. "I was born without one." 

For instance, a blog, a twitter novel or something like the mixture of a website and a novel. The reason I didn't describe the character earlier, is that I didn't want the description to sound forced. Still, I wonder if I should try to move it to the beginning? To prevent the reader from forming a false physical image of the MC? I wonder if both characters sound the same. If so, how can I do to make them sound more "different"?
