Because of the exceptional examples in my dialect, a phonologist who believes in phonemes would have to concede that I actually have two separate phonemes, /aɪ/ and /ʌɪ/, in my inventory. There's no other way to explain minimal pairs like cider vs. sider and high school (the lexicalized compound) vs. high school (meaning 'a school that is high'). When I first mentioned all of these examples to a colleague of mine, she wouldn't believe me; she thought I was making them up. She finally came around when I pointed her to this Wikipedia article! In analyzing my dialect I would still posit a regular rule/constraint that keeps /aɪ/ from surfacing as [aɪ] before voiceless coda consonants, but such a rule would not be sufficient to cover all the cases. There is actually a family of variants for what you are calling the "softer d"--the variants can respectively be transcribed in IPA as [dj], [dʲ], [d͡ʑ], and [d͡ʒ]. Remember that in IPA [j] (called yod) stands for the sound at the beginning of the word yell, and the symbol [d͡ʒ] stands for the sound at the beginning of the word gel. When you used the letter j in your question, I'm guessing the sound you had in mind was more like the latter, although by placing the letter d before it you were perhaps approximating one of the "intermediate" sounds ([dʲ] or [d͡ʑ]). I refer you to the Wikipedia article on IPA and the relevant linked articles (you can click on individual symbols in the IPA chart for in-depth explanations of them) for a review of the sounds represented by these symbols. There you can also read about the differences in articulation among these different sounds, but generally speaking the articulatory differences between [d] and the variants mentioned here have to do with the placement of the tongue immediately after the closure (farther back for the variants than for the [d]) and the speed at which the tongue blade moves away from the roof of the mouth (more sluggish for the variants than for the [d]). Those facts alone may not be that surprising, but there are certain seemingly exceptional examples in my dialect that make it less than straightforward to analyze from a phonological perspective. For example, in most cases the raising is only "triggered" when the voiceless consonant is in the same morpheme as the diphthong--so [ʌɪ] appears in ice cream but not I scream. But there are exceptions to this generalization--[ʌɪ] occurs in high school (when it refers to the institution of secondary education). Also, as you mentioned, the raised version of the diphthong occurs in some cases before voiced consonants! It appears in spider, idle, and cyber, for example. Finally, it can even appear before [nt], as in pint (as opposed to pined).
