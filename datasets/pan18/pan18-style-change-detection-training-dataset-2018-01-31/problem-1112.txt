Though some answers+comments say that this is optional, there is no source given. So I think this question makes sense. 

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_ball#What_constitutes_a_No_ball 

When the records are compared, bowler B1 will look very bad, while bowler B2 will look very good. To high-light this type of issue , records (statistics) of drop-catches and stumping-failures will be very helpful. Eg For making "World XI teams" or "Dream teams". 

Consider a very bad bowler (or an average bowler) B2 with a great wicket-keeper who never misses opportunities for stump-out or catch-behind. Also the fielders are too good, such that they stretch and jump beyond reasonable limits to convert sixes to caught-outs. 

Disadvantages : A penalty run is given away. Maybe more runs if the batsman can hit it. Maybe more runs in the next penalty ball. In 20-20 format, a free-hit also gives away more runs. Wickets (catch, stumping, etc) might be potentially taken, but the effort will be lost, only because of the no-ball. (( Case In Point : http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/match/worldt20-2016/34 , ICC World Twenty20 2016 Semi-Final 2 , March 31st 2016 , Wankhede Stadium , West Indies won by 7 wickets )) 

Advantages : None that I can think of. One very unlikely possibility was that the bowler wants to maximise the speed for the batsman, or minimise the Distance for the ball to travel. But if this is a real advantage, then there should be no batsmen batting from outside the crease. More-over, batsmen would not be charging down towards the ball. Hence this advantage does not sound correct. 

"If a ball qualifies as a no ball as well as a wide, the umpire will call it a no ball instead of a wide, and all the rules for a no ball apply." 

Are drop-catches and stumping-failures recorded for official statistics ? 

Here is a possible reason for specifying batting order. 

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_%28cricket%29 : 

So coming back to the question : Do the laws of cricket allow running on the last ball, even after winning ?
