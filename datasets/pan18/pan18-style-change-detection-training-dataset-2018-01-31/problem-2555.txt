In Sanskrit, there is a quotative particle iti, which you would use in something like "he is known as Bhagavān", "he is called Bhagavān", which seems to be along the lines of what you're looking for. 

This also happens in Shona and some other African languages, and there's a book on the topic, Quotative Indexes in African Languages: A Synchronic and Diachronic Survey by Tom Güldemann, which mentions other languages with this construction. 

David Lewis' account of the logic of imperatives is in terms of the possible worlds in which the imperative is obeyed. Here is a handout for a class which extensively deals with the formal semantics of questions. 

Anyhow, there is more to what linguists do than assign semantic interpretations to sentences. We use formalisms for all aspects of language, and at least for the non-quantitative, the interpretation of those formalisms requires the use of logic. Formal logic is important in interpreting these formalisms, since it provides a clear method of interpretation. Modal logic has proven useful in accounting for the meaning of sentences, and is of no use in interpreting phonological rules. Not every useful tool have to be useful for all problems. 

They argue that the introduction of additional arguments to a construction correlates with the introduction of additional event structure to a predicate. So since "have" systematically introduces a new argument, it also systematically introduces more event structure. It is unspecified, however, for what kind of extra event structure it contributes. It can thus be interpreted as extending the event beyond the original starting point of the event - in which case the introduced argument will be interpreted as the causer of the event. Or it can be interpreted as extending the event beyond the original ending point of the event - in which case the introduced argument will be interpreted as the experiencer/affectee of the event. (I tried to schematize this below in a sort of diagram.) 

Under either approach to plurality, a singular and plural form have distinct denotations, so I don't think they would be considered the same word semantically (assuming that the notion of a semantic word would correspond to a denotation, although I don't know if that is what's usually done.)

The second regards roots vs. words. If "glit" is a verb, you can form multiple inflected forms from it such as "glits", "glitted", "glitting" and so on. Some people don't want to include inflected forms because they aren't "really" different words, they are just forms of one word. Which then requires you to ask "What do you mean by 'word'?". There are languages with very robust morphology which allow huge numbers of words, and languages with recursive or at least iterative morphology, which have infinite word-formation potential. 

In the realm of questions about what constitutes a "word", I believe from his comments here that John Lawler has a position to the effect that Lushootseed utterances are not composed of multiple words, they are composed of multiple morphemes, and "word" is not a useful concept in analyzing the structure of the language (leaving aside a possible and under-investigated stress-related facts). It is certainly not obvious that a distinction between "sentence" and "word" is mandatory for the language.

As for other languages with similar predicates, they propose that the Japanese adversative -rare is similar to "have," but specified as extending the endpoint (hence the argument is always an experiencer/affectee), and that the French faire is similar to "have" but specified as extending the initial point (hence the argument is always a causer). There are also both benefactive and malefactive interpretations for some Salish applicatives (see, for example, Kiyosawa & Gerdts 2010. Some googling has also resulted in a book "Benefactives and malefactives: Typological perspectives and case studies" by Zuniga and Zeppo (2010). That might give you a good place to look for the crosslinguistic morphosyntactic properties of malefactives. 

They argue that the introduction of additional arguments to a construction correlates with the introduction of additional event structure to a predicate. So since "have" systematically introduces a new argument, it also systematically introduces more event structure. It is unspecified, however, for what kind of extra event structure it contributes. It can thus be interpreted as extending the event beyond the original starting point of the event - in which case the introduced argument will be interpreted as the causer of the event. Or it can be interpreted as extending the event beyond the original ending point of the event - in which case the introduced argument will be interpreted as the experiencer/affectee of the event.
