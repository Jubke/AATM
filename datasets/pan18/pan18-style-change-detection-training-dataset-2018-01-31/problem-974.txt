As a preface, I've stopped using Stack Overflow after participating in the beta and using the system for a while. I'm not trying to stir up controversy or ruffle feathers, though that seems likely to happen. Rather this is a postmortem of one user's experience with Stack Overflow. (I don't have the heart to mess with the other verses.) 

My first job involved some scripting of devices using the serial port and our technology of choice was ProComm Plus. The company that made that software (Datastorm Technologies, Inc.) was bought out (by Quarterdeck which was in turn bought by Symantec) and the software was discontinued in 2002. So the scripting language I used, ASPECT, just isn't being used anymore. So there are no questions about it and no tags that I can use in the "Technologies" field. (aspect seems to be a grabbag of junk; much of it relates to display or image technology.) 

The FAQ says: "Reputation is completely optional. Normal use of Stack Overflow — that is, asking and answering questions — does not require any reputation whatsoever." The first sentence is, of course, a lie. If you participate on Stack Overflow, you have a reputation number whether you like it or not. In addition, the "reputation" concept forms the core of the Stack Overflow experience by design. The second sentence clarifies the first to explain the nugget of truth: you don't need to understand the reputation concept in order to begin working with Stack Overflow. In other words, the reputation system is extrinsic by design. You can even spot the noticeable dip of 2014 which conincided with the observation that Stack Overflow had become particularly negative. So while this metric is not perfect, it is simple and seems to accurately track the community's evaluation of new questions as they come in. When tackling technical solutions to question quality, we can be confident we're on the right track if there's a statistically meaningful increase in "good" questions as defined above.
