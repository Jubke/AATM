The commentary shows that a woman may lead the prayers among other women, or among a mixed gender within her household, and attributes this to Abi Thawr. The allegation that Abu Thawr said a woman may lead prayers among mixed genders at large is unknown where it originated from. I have come across some modernists claims that it is in Sunnan Al-Daraqutni, but I have not found anything to that effect in his book. 

'Umar ibn al-Khattab saw a group of men racing to a specific place to pray. He asked: "What is this?" They said: "This is a place where the Prophet (ﷺ) prayed." He said: "Do you want to take the footsteps of your prophets as mosques? This is what made those who were before you perish. When it is the time of prayers, pray wherever you are, otherwise go." 

Inna li Allah wa inna elaih raje'oon. Hasbi Allah wa ni'm Al-Wakeel. Wa la hawl wa la quwwata ella bi Allah. 

'Abdul-Rahman ibn Khallad Al-Ansari 

So they looked for such a person and found none who knew more Qur'an than I because of the Qur'anic material which I used to learn from the caravans. They therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a boy of six or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very short for me (and my body became partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, "Won't you cover the anus of your reciter for us?" So they bought (a piece of cloth) and made a shirt for me. I had never been so happy with anything before as I was with that shirt. 

O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination. 

From this hadith, it is proven that a woman can lead the prayers of her female community, based on the command of the Prophet (ﷺ). Aisha lead the prayers among women, and so did Umm Salama in fard prayers and in taraweeh.
