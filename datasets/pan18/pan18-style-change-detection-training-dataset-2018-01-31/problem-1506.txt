Yes. It's wrong and it's silly to us - but if your teacher told you the same lie, every day you'd start to believe it in the end. 

This is the line I've taken, for better or worse... 

Like in school we trust teachers to be telling the truth about things in lessons. The people who attacked France, were told lies by their teachers but they really, really believe them - they think that we're bad people and they're good. So they want us to live their way. 

Essentially 'synthetic phonics' is thought to be the best method currently available for teaching English and claims give a correct or 'good enough' pronunciation of around 85% of English words, plus it is relatively quick. There is also another phonics system called Analytic Phonics which is considered slower and tends to place more emphasis on phonemes at the beginning of each word. 

The chances of being caught up in an attack are very small, even if you live in one of the big cities that they like to target. For a start you have to be in the right place on the right day, at the right time of day. With approximately 2,270,000 people living in Paris (that doesn't include the visitors). 200 people were hurt or killed (last I heard), that's less than one person in every 11,000 people in Paris. Have a think about what 11,000 people look like - it's a lot of people! 

Take the two words you've compared. 

Also, even if you happen to be caught up in an attack it's pretty likely though it might be horrible that you will probably survive. My wife was at Edgware Rd tube station in London when the 7/7 bombings happened and the thing is that, as well as her, hundreds of other people were there too. But only a few were hurt.
