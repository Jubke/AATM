It is interesting that Kant here simply refers to the philosophical tradition and quotes one of the fundamental metaphysical principles. He makes no attempt to argue why conservation of substance is a valid principle. Neither does he give any argument why the abstract, and at best qualitative concept of substance equates with the quantitative concept of matter. Did Kant consider it not necessary? 

Rawl's veil of ignorance is a means to generate fair decisions in case of a conflict of interests. It can be used for all votings where the consequences of the result affect at least some of the voting people.
