In the case that player B bets $60, and player A calls, the pot increases to 400 + 60 + 60. The expected total income from player A is therefore: 66 * 4/52 * 3/51 * 48/50 * .... * 39/41 = 0.1902 = 19.02% Expected Income = (35/44)*(400 + 60 + 60) + (9/44)0 = (35/44)(400 + 60 + 60). Consider 2 scenarios, in which a flop has given you an approx. 33% chance of making an Ace high flush by the river. The pot size is currently 600 and there is 1 player remaining. It costs 200 to call. Scenario 2. Again you call the bet of 200 after the flop, and again the turn card doesn't give you your flush. Now your opponent is a very aggressive player and bets 1000 chips, bringing the pot size to 1800. This gives you odds of 1:1.8, which is definitely not enough to call on a 20% chance of making your flush on the river. You must fold. <(A)>=(35/44)*400 + (9/44)*0 = (35/44)*400 = 318 First calculate the probability that no aces are dealt to 6 players (12 cards): The probability of 1 and only 1 Ace being dealt is given by: Therefore expectation of profits = (35/44)*460 - (9/44)*60 = 353 The first approach gives the formula, Now in this scenario, it was only correct to call the initial bet of 200 on the basis that you will see 2 more cards. However against such an aggressive player, it can be shown mathematically that calling after the flop in this situation will yield a long term net loss, since 80% of the time you are going to fold on the turn, only seeing 1 card, not 2 which the pot odds were calculated for. However player A has to wager an additional $60 in this case, regardless of the outcome. Therefore the expected PROFITS is thus, The only combination of ranks that will give you a straight is 4-5. Then, Probability of hitting the first card: 10/47; Probability of hitting the second card: 9/46; Randomly dealing a turn and a river on the example hole cards and flop from your example 10 000 times got me these results: idem for the second card (but there are only 5 of them left in the deck). And with no gap, like in the example you gave, there are 3 types of combinations that will give you a straight: 2-3, 3-7 and 7-8. Each of them has 1.48% so you have 4.44% chance of hitting your straight. Hole cards: 2:diamonds:3:diamonds:. Flop: T:hearts:6:diamonds:J:spades:. By multiplying the two, you get (10/47 * 9/46) =~ 4.16% the second card must be one of the 4 cards of the other rank (if, for example, a 5 was dealt on the turn, the 4 cards are 4c, 4d, 4h, 4s). Probability of hitting the first card: 8/47; Probability of hitting the second card: 4/46; Other: (No Pair, One Pair): 8228 Not considering the turns and rivers with ranks matching the cards of the board, you will hit a trips or two pair if: Now in this scenario, it was only correct to call the initial bet of 200 on the basis that you will see 2 more cards. However against such an aggressive player, it can be shown mathematically that calling after the flop in this situation will yield a long term net loss, since 80% of the time you are going to fold on the turn, only seeing 1 card, not 2 which the pot odds were calculated for.
