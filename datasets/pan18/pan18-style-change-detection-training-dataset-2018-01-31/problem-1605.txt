Goes to washroom herself, never has had accidents. We use diapers on her at night only because we don't want to bother ourselves. 

Yes, I know about story reading. She is full of energy all the time. What are the non stimulating games that can be played before bedtime? 

Kid is 4 year old. I want her to feel sleepy before bedtime so that it becomes easy for us to put her to bed. Problem is if I do not engage her in some non-stimulating activity, she keeps on jumping and running around. 

I think she "deserves" the praise because as I have seen on this site, almost all the parents have been complaining of improper behavior and several types of problems with their own children of the same age. She's different. 

Nearly zero tantrums. I have to tell her only once that she needs to keep all the blocks and toys that she threw around back in the box. She tells me to help which I do. She does her share of work very properly. She has empathy, says sorry when she needs to, helps to clean around the house when required, and has a great attention span too. 

Now, the result is that this 4 year old is a very patient, quite hard working kid - when she's with me. She doesn't pay too much attention to her father's words many times because he doesn't act, just talks, doesn't follow up regularly. 

What is the proper way to praise the hard work and patience of a child such that she doesn't start depending on my praises? 

Now, on such occasions, I say, "You cleaned the room properly by putting all the toys in the box. You worked hard. Thanks for that! You indeed have a great patience". 

Problem is that she mostly always behaves properly. Punishing her is rarely required. No bribes have been given till date. I am feeling that I am praising her too much because of the great amount of proper behavior from her side. 

Be assertive about finding out what the school expects of entering kindergartners and the school's suggestions on how you can help your youngster to be prepared. 

In order to hear you and your concerns they need to understand you are on the same team with them in trying to figure out what is best for their child. 

Since I grew up on an island and we still go back there every summer, we spend a lot of time in boats and around water so the water safety considerations in general as well as those specific to open water are very real for us. The rate of deaths in children due to drowning are quite high compared to other causes so I always pushed her to learn. Looking back, I might have been less pushy about it. 

It can also help them all through their preschool and school years to have a "fidget" to use to focus their energy into a small, non-distracting fidget they can use while listening to something else. 

You are also well within your rights to do some family counseling if you choose to. A little conversation with an expert around to do some of the conflict resolution and teach all of you skills that will help you understand each-other better is a good thing for anyone. 

I would only add as a piece of information rather than advice, that at four (at least in our area) they can be signed up for Martial Arts which not only helps to develop the ABILITY to fight, but confidence in general (for example, the goal of board breaking is simply to develop confidence, to let the child know they are capable of something our brains tell us is impossible). I caution that she should only be signed up for such an activity, if she wishes to be and Martial Arts should not be forced on her in any way. 

"Oh! Really? cool what was it?" 

Additionally, kids often just want what you have because you have it (you are pretty cool after-all) so when you combine this fact, with the fact that they are testing how much influence they can have, you have kids that get "moody" until they get what they want. I have taught both preschool (two to four years old) and Middleschool (adolscent years) and always laughed when people asked how I could switch from one to the other so easily - its the same thing! Older kids just have a bigger vocabulary of "bad words" and "moody tactics" (well, and the ability to deceive). 

In regard to Martial Arts, my daughter started at five and her dojo allows kids to start as early as four but not younger (officially). This article is written by a Judo instructor that seems to agree four is the earliest age for martial arts. Martial arts, like swimming gives kids some great life skills (including along with the physical activity, but won't (until later belts) really help with spatial awareness. In regard to body awareness, Taekwondo (at our studio) desn't really seem to stress body awareness until the second belt. I don't know about other styles.
