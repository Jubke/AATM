And all of this is done in code. No storyboards or xibs are involved. Under iOS 7 or 8, the stock Calendar app does something that I have been unable to figure out. I've tested a few more locales. The following show long month names: Here's the complete code for the search bar: So then I ran the following code to find all locales that use punctuation in the short month symbols and those that don't: What I can't figure out is how to know which month format to use. Does anyone have any idea how to make this determination? fr_FR, de_DE, ru_RU, sv_SE (actually all locales for each of these languages) Any other suggestions to help fix all of this code? This is not a trivial code base. There are hundreds of source files to deal with. This is a major refactoring effort. the following (and I'm sure many more) show the short month: See the Receipt Validation Programming Guide for details on receipt validation. en_US, en_GB, es_ES, it_IT, nl_NL, ca_ES, uk_UA, ro_RO (actually all locales for each of these languages) I thought I found a solution but it doesn't work for all locales that I tried. I ran the following code with various locales to see if I could find anything in common between locales that show the short and long months names in the Calendar app: As of iOS 7, this can be done using proper receipt validation. Under iOS 7 you can obtain a receipt for the purchased app. Part of the data in the receipt includes information about the original purchase version of the app by the user. You can look at that version and if it is from before the release of your update to free with IAP, you can choose to give the user the full functionality without the user needing to purchase the upgrade again. Something like this should work: And now since iOS 10.1 and Xcode 8.1 are out of beta, be sure you update to the latest, non-beta of both.
