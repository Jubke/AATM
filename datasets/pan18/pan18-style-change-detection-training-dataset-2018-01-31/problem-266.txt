This is possible from the beginning, I'm running around electrocuting enemies with my right hand and blocking with a shield on my left hand pretty much since the beginning of the game. I had the same issue, it automatically picky my Gamepad as input on first starting Skyrim. There was an option called "360 Controller" in the System->Settings menu, after disabling it Skyrim defaults to mouse and keyboard on every start. The giants are one of the enemies that are present very early, but they don't adjust down to your early levels. They always have a certain minimum level, if you meet them early in the game they will be probably tens of levels above you. To activate the spell or block with your shield the mouse buttons are reversed from assigning, you activate your right hand with a left lick and your left hand with a right click. The dragons are part of the main quest, they are more closely adjusted to your level as the developers also had to expect some people directly starting with the main quest, not earning levels before that with side quests. The giants are passive, you can avoid them pretty easily. So having them far above your level doesn't stop your progress at all. Alright, I own 4 houses in Skyrim, so here im listing the houses and its book space numbers (Only Interactive bookshelves). Solitude's Proudspire Manor: I havent bought the house yet, but I will when I have the money, in the meantime according to Ricky, the house has 6 bookshelves with 2 shelves each. 11 X 6 X 2 = 132. Markarth's Vlindrel Hall: In front of Alchemy Lab - 3 Bookshelves with 3 shelves each (18+18+18 + 18+18+18 + 18+18+18). Windhelm's Hjerim: By the stairs - 1 Bookshelf with 2 shelves (11+11), Secret Room - 1 Bookshelf with 2 shelves (11+11), Kitchen - 1 Bookshelf with 2 shelves (11+11), Armory - 1 Bookshelf with 2 shelves (11+11), Bedroom - 1 Bookshelf with 4 shelves (11+11+11+11). Riften's Honeyside: Bedroom - 1 Bookshelf with 2 shelves (18+18), Basement - 1 Bookshelf with 2 shelves (18+18). If posible, just try to finish the quest by yourself :) unless its bugged of course. I just bought that house in order to get the Windhelm Home Decorating Guide book. Markarth - Vlindrel Hall: 162 Books The first giant I met killed me with one hit, flinging me high up in the air. Now at around level 40 I can kill a giant with 2-4 hits of my daedric mace. I wasn't fast enough to get a screenshot of this loading screen I had the same issue, it automatically picky my Gamepad as input on first starting Skyrim.

This is possible from the beginning, I'm running around electrocuting enemies with my right hand and blocking with a shield on my left hand pretty much since the beginning of the game. Enemies in Skyrim are, within certain bounds, adjusted to your own level. So the first dragons you meet will likely be pretty low level, as you're probably still at a very early level yourself. It should look like this, where both the shield and the spell are marked in the inventory and favorite list: Solitude's Proudspire Manor: I havent bought the house yet, but I will when I have the money, in the meantime according to Ricky, the house has 6 bookshelves with 2 shelves each. 11 X 6 X 2 = 132. Whiterun - Breezehome: 47 Books Riften's Honeyside: Bedroom - 1 Bookshelf with 2 shelves (18+18), Basement - 1 Bookshelf with 2 shelves (18+18). If posible, just try to finish the quest by yourself :) unless its bugged of course. If you are using PC you can use the console command setstage followed by the quest ID to "finish" any quest. UESP has the list of quests and inside each you can see its ID. To open the console command use the tilde-key (~), it sits before the "1" key and under the ESC-key.
