I thinking it might be best to use event blubbling attached to the body tag and then just keep resetting a timer for 30 minutes, but I'm not exactly sure how to create this. The situation I have is, as follows: Are you giving the new file fields new names? Are you overwriting any existing innerHTML or just appending? I'm wondering what you would do as I'm trying to avoid having the HTML in 2 places. Would you put all the HTML in JS? Or would you put all of the HTML on the server (PHP) and call with AJAX? Or would you just have the HTML in 2 places? (BTW, the case I'm working which has 5 columns and a lot more HMTL.) Edit: I'm more needing to know if they are actively using the site, therefore clicking (changing fields or position within a field or selecting checkboxes/radios) or typing (in an input, textarea, etc). If they are in another tab or using another program, then my assumption is they are not using the site and therefore should be logged out (for security reasons). Also, you may want to look at when your script to generate the ads is being loaded and run. I suspect it's run before and never sees this code. I have the following situation: I want to trigger the submit event of the form the current element is in. A method I know works sometimes is: I thinkk the problem is that you need to put something inside your alert(), such as: So, is there a way to have jQuery retrieve the form the input/select/textarea is in? My question/problem is: in the javascript, I need to have the full HTML to generate each of the rows or perform an AJAX request to get the new row from the server. On the server I need to have the HTML to generate the rows when the users comes back to edit or do I pass the values using a json array.
