Now coming to your question, about taking name at different positions etc, if this is cultural thing and there is a reason of doing this and people will not confuse it with your father name, than there is no issue, but if this is not cultural thing and can be confused as your father name, than don't do it. Its as simple as that. From a proper fatwa Here on a similar question: Allahu a'lam it's like youre rejecting the verses from the Quran completely by saying yolo. So, to be on safe side avoid this as much as possible even though you don't mean it. And they say, "There is none but our worldly life, and we will not be resurrected." I read somewhere: The non muslims say YOLO So, Do all the misdeeds this dunya has to offer. The muslim says YOLO(in this world) So, Make salaah go on hajj and prove you believe. Now, one reason being given by some fatawas is that it is imitation of kuffaar. While if this is cultural norm somewhere, like in our area of india and pakistan etc, then it's not imitation, it's just cultural thing. And a thing which does not contradict with islamic teachings so it cannot be HARAAM!! PS: I know there can be great difference of opinion on this topic, we can discuss it in a good manner. Leave a positive comment and we will discuss about it. And their is a saying of prophet(PBUH) Being a software engineer, i am also now days having an offer of a related project, and i am trying my best to avoid it, and i believe supporting any sin is as bad as the sin itself... Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Edit2: This hadees tells how swear matter this is, and how much we need to be stay away from it, it is not just about intoxication of alcohol. Edit: Today i found this hadees. What it means by "ascribes himself to someone other than his (real) father" is to say HE IS MY FATHER, while he is not. And you know it he is not your father and you are still letting people to believe he is your father. It's not that we need that father's name in our name...
