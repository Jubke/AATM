Update - pointed the links to the new ones. I found a tutorial divided into 4 parts from a blog on how to zoom and pan an image and it is quite nice. It has sample codes that can be downloaded and some explanations. It also have other tutorials. Update 2 - I found a ready-to-use class for ImageView zooming functionality. You check it out here. I tried creating an xml resource layout... and it somehow works... By declaring first the right textview, its required width will be computed first and occupy the view while the textview on the left will occupy the remaining space of the view. Maybe you can try listening to both the network provider and gps provider for a certain amount of time and then check the results from the two. If you don't have results from the gps, use the network results instead. That's how I did it. I still have not tried this though it might give you some idea. you can retrieve a Fragment by tag through android will return a String with I am starting developing a new application based on fragments. What I want to achieve is something similar to an activity group. Talking in fragments I was thinking to start create a FragmentActivity (call it TabActivity) that would manages different tabs. Every tab is compound of a ListFragment and I need to start different fragment based on the user input. My idea lets implement the TabActivity different CallBackListener (one for ListFragment) and, based on the call back called, create a new fragment. Could be this a correct solution? I found the documentation a bit confusing and a little frustrating... with Retrofit 2.0 you have to declare in your build.gradle the convert factory you want to use. Add Or you can also use, getShortWeekdays() Does somebody know a library with the HTTP client pipelining support? EDIT: my question is why I need to clear the backstack everytime I switch between ListFragment in order to avoid that content of the Fragment overlaps. What I am making wrong i draw 4 lines (canvas.drawLine) in order to draw a rectangle. Is there any possibility to fill the area of the rectangle? (I know that android have a rectDraw. Mine is only curiosity) I have the following scenario. A tabhost manages four ListFragmnet. For every ListFragment I have several fragment. For instance associated with the ListFragmnet 1 I have the fragments A, B, C and can happens that fragment A "launch" fragment B which can launch fragment C. Is correct to allow fragments to start each other or is there a more correct way? if you declared this flag, the activity will not be destroyed and recreated and the callback What I think the problem with the code is in the line I tried creating an xml resource layout... and it somehow works...
