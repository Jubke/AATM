Shia Muslims pray with their hands by their sides. (As per What are the major differences between Sunni and Shi'i prayer?) Question: What can a Muslim do when dining with Christian friends who say grace? which is listed as "It is recommended for the woman who is performing ghusl following menses to apply a piece of cloth scented with musk to the site of the bleeding". These two items are possibly enough to be able to fit in, but I'm unsure if I'm missing something. I'm not going to be capable of reciting Arabic, other than al Fatiha (and al Humazah now) and the tashahhud. Sahih Muslim contains the hadith I interpret "his/her people" as meaning "his/her family" (which seems to match some translations at Islam Awakened and this answer to my previous question). A convert, for example, may not have any Muslim family members, and I'm wondering if they can use non-Muslim family members for arbitration. Sahih al-Bukhari contains a similar hadith: Where "O" indicates an excerpt from Umar Barakat's commentary, and "N" indicates commentary by Sheikh Nuh Ali Salman. As for whether or not synthetic musk would cause women's health problems, that's a bit beyond the scope of this site. However, it seems reasonable to believe that a lot of women are using it for this purpose, and I would expect it would be widely reported if it were problematic (outside of, say, cases of skin conditions and allergies). (b) ... the private parts of the nonvirgin woman which are normally disclosed when she squats to relieve herself. I prayed once before in a mosque in Iran (my first time ever in a mosque; my only time in Iran), and the lady next to me just said "copy me", so I did. Inshallah, I will go to Iran again in May. I intend to pray in the mosques there and I would like to fit in better with my (presumably mostly Shia) sisters when doing so.
