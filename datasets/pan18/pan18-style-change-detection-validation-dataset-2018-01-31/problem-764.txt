All of a sudden, she is shy about reading out loud during family reading time, because she is worried about not reading quickly and smoothly. We are re-reading The Hobbit at the moment and she reads it almost as well as her Dad. 

Admittedly, there are times, when her father gets a bit impatient - he has a hard time listening to others reading to begin with as he has adult ADD and looses focus easily. What can I do to help my daughter regain her confidence as well as help my husband understand why it is important to maintain his patience when she does run into a new word or trips up a little? 

In regard to the other two questions My husband is also not vigilant about asking her if she has her; coat, water bottle and bag so he is working on getting better about at least asking for those three items when he picks her up from somewhere. At the same time, I would like her to be a bit more independent and not need us to remind about things at each pick-up - at least eventually (I know there is a learning process involved and I can't expect this over-night). Her methods of stalling tend to be the same ones most kids use and I have countermoves for most of them. However, I am amazed at how she can easily trick other adults (and yes, sometimes I fall for it too - occasionally) into engaging in conversations with her that delay whatever it is she is attempting to delay. My six year old daughter is just transitioning into attending classes and activities more independently. As this is happening, she may get dropped off by her dad and picked up by me (and vice versa). This means things are getting left behind. I know it is pretty typical for a six year old to spread stuff out and forget it when staying elsewhere, hanging out at a friends or a club location. In fact, I remember this being a common complaint from the parents of kids I taught in Middle School and even my Highschool Biology kids had trouble with it.
