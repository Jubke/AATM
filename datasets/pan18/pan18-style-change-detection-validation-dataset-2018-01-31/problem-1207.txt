Of coarse today we know Roosevelt was already actively involved in impeachable offenses to provide Britain with significant material aid. Roosevelt was against Germany, and was working behind the scenes to keep the UK in the war, to prepare the US military, to change US public opinion, and to get us into the war as quickly as he could.

In 1892, nationwide steel production surpassed that of iron for the first time. > 

The 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner, three civil rights workers, in Mississippi. Put a huge public spot light on Klan activity. 

Calhoun had been John Quincy Adams' Vice President and had switched parties during the election, and stayed in Washington as VP when Jackson was elected. 

The Marshal Plan was financed by the United States to the tune of 13 billion dollars in 1948 money (over 130 billion in 2017 dollars), allowed many countries economies ravaged by war to rebuild their infrastructure on the US dime. You are correct that East Germany got about 11% of the overall package or about 1.4 billion. That's the simplified definition. The more complicated definition was mostly it was loans, and mostly the folks who ultimately received the money were US businesses. In 1948 if you wanted to buy things to get your economy rolling ( heavy machinery, mills for steel, production equipment ). The United States was you most likely source. So not only was the Marshal Plan very good for Europe, It was very good for the United States too. That's what we call good business. It should not be confused with charity, a gift, or some sort of guilty conscience war reparations. 

General Fox Connor was able to pull strings inside the Army with the help of his former mentor General Pershing, and Pershing's staff officer George Marshal. Eisenhower was transferred to Fox Connor's command. Eisenhower previous problems disappeared except for an written reprimand which remained part of his record. Marshal's role in this transfer was likely the first time Eisenhower came to Marshal's attention. 

What was the long term ramifications of the United States tussle with the Barbary Pirates? Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic Republicans recognized the worth of a standing professional navy. Lots of tribute paid in the mean while.

In the years following the Civil war the South was bankrupt. It's industry and farms were unserviceable and their credit was depleted. Making the South pay unilaterally for the Norths debt would have been the same as defaulting. It was not an option. The Union was much more concerned with the "repudiation crisis" / scenario. 

Roosevelt made the statement in Boston because he would not have been elected had he not. Roosevelt was a consummate politician who knew the country would not support another foreign war and his hands were tied legally from supporting Britain. 

The bill of rights(1791) didn't apply to slaves. But parts of the United States Constitution(1787) did. Specifically the Slave Clause, Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3. 

The comparison between the soviet gulag system and US prison system would have to be made on % population confined. Iâ€™ve seen no numbers on that, nor did you provide numbers, other comparisons such as economic would fail to compare. 

I agree with Danny's answer, except about the economics. Economics had nothing to do with the ending of the Gulag system. Purely from an economic standpoint, the Gulags were pretty solid. Profit isn't the right word because gulags were run by the state, but as for economic benefits of the gulag systems for the state, they were well beyond significant. Right before the war, Gulags provided 46.5% of the nation's nickel, 76% of its tin, 40% of its cobalt, 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber. So Gulag's weren't merely a significant part of the Soviet Economy in the 30's, 40's and early 50's. They were the economy. The Soviet Union was dependent upon them for the materials which made the rest of the economy go. 

I would further say that while most in the north were willing to let slavery die over a prolonged period by limiting their power in the congress and denying them new state members; after the supreme court decision of 1857, that started to change. The Dred Scott decision; radicalized the North as much as the reaction to the Kansas Nebraska act radicalized the mid west. The Dred Scott decision effectively legalized slavery in the north. Slave holders were free to bring their slaves to the north, and worse run rough shot over local laws in capturing "escaped slaves".. Or any free people of color they pleased. This was a pretty hard pill for the north to swallow and accounts for the rise in popularity of the Republican Party in the North leading up to the 1860 elections.
