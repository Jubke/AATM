Now that she has things down pretty well, I can choose to be a lot more lax about it (like at events such as a wedding), but I did have to be a bit strict about things for the first little while to make she she really got the drill. I also adjusted for things like the late snacks you mentioned, or if she was ill or something and kept an eye out for possible allergic reactions to things. I really tried to make sure that first month I was as regular and routine about her eating schedule as was humanly possible in order to try to maintain that consistency I mentioned. 

Same thing with cleaning. If she doesn't put away her toys and you have to clean them up. The toys are no longer available - not because you have taken them, but because in real life, leaving stuff out and around results in those things being broken or lost and the room unusable. Since other family members have to use the room you are just putting the toys away where they are out of the way of the other family members (then tell her how she can earn the toys back. The method should be related somehow to demonstrating her willingness and ability to take better care of her things). 

Now that she is seven however, she doesn't want to have to wear a life-vest at the pool and friends were inviting her to pool parties and the like all the time last spring. She agreed to give lessons a chance and to "breathe through her fear" at an indoor and heated pool. She loves the lessons now - she sees a self-motivating reason to participate and really give it a shot. We're even listening to the Michael Phelps book, "No Limits" on CD because she is sudddenly CRAZY INTERESTED in swimming.
