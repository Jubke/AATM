I quit the job alhamdulaylah, inshaAllah, may Allah bless the act, ameen. 

It has been consulted with a knowledgeable Imam and a knowledge Muslim brother about the issue. What they concluded is that letting beard grow is 'CLOSE TO' fard in most opinion, but some consider its fard (as brother Al Ummat stated). I asked it again in here and in hope for a even more detailed and professional Islamic explanation on it so more brothers have similar situation can benefit from it, inshaAllah. 

Alhamdulaylah, its so blessed to did Allah allowed me to achieve. Now, I am capable of paying off my loan without even worry about money and more. alhamdulaylah. Its amazing how Allah swt reward and bless one with so much mercy and surprisingly wonderful! Put your trust in Allah swt, he will reward you abundantly inshaAllah, ameen! Do what pleases Allah swt, and you will NEVER regret, inshaAllah! Lesson learned, again and again, alhamdulaylah! I am still looking for a suitable job for my further development since the current career I am in is NOT of my profession, and inshaAllah, Allah will guide me to the career I so far deemed as halal and what my passion is (web development). 

For my particular situation, both of them agree that I should stay in the job because that fact that I need to support the family and meanwhile looking for another job that comply with our Islamic standard on beard. 

================Update========================= NOTE: I do NOT clearly remember what is the regulation stated that its ok for me to do so, so I will not take it as a final answer, but if you think its helpful for you anyway in determine it, I will be very happy.

I say this because according to the dictionary, all kinds of roughly means the same thing as all manner of or all sorts of: 

Languor: The state or feeling, often pleasant, of tiredness or inertia My personal view of the 2 sections above (so take with a pinch of salt) I am assuming this means that you can do a contract on the day the loan is taken based on the weight of gold. If a loan of 10k is required, you work out the weight of gold 10k would get. For arguments sake, lets assume that is 1kg of gold. Then when paying the loan back many years later, you don't necessarily pay back 10k, you pay back whatever the cost of 1kg of gold is. So if in 2013 when you pay the loan back, 1kg of gold costs 50k, you pay back 50k. Why do people pray salah differently? All this can basically be regarded as maslahah (public interest) or sadd a-dhrai' (closing a halal "door" which may lead to haram) in the osol al-fiqh (see for example What are basic (osol al fiqh) differences & similarities between the 4 (existing) Legal Sunni Schools: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, & Shafi'i?
