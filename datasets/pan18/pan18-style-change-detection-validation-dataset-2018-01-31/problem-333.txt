[tl:dr, go to last couple paragraphs] The way this works out to the same thing is thus: First of all, pot odds and odds of winning are both ratios and thus comparable to each other, and indeed they should be compared to each other. For example, (staying with the 40% figure you use) let's say you're facing a bet of $40 into what had been a $20 dollar pot--so you need to call $40 to contest what is now a $60 pot. Your pot odds are then the amount in the pot ($60) to the amount you have to call ($40), so you're getting 60:40, or 3:2 pot odds. Yes, one way of thinking about this is that (going back to the 40% chance of winning) if you played out this hand 10 times you'd expect to win 4 times with a profit of $60 and lose 6 times with a loss of $40 for a net of $0. With a 45% chance of winning, you could say you'll win 4.5/10 at a gain of $60 and 5.5/10 at a loss of $40, which amounts to +$50 over 10 hands, for an average gain of $5 which equals the EV from above. It's more practical though to just use straight percentages and calculate out a single hand than to add a denominator just to reduce by it at the end. You would compare this pot odds ratio to the ratio of your probability of losing versus your probability of winning. For example, if you expect to win 40% of the time and lose 60%, then that gives a ratio of 60:40 and is breakeven with the pot odds. You want the pot odds to be favorable, thus bigger, than your ratio of losing:winning probabilities. So if you expect to win 45% of the time, the new ratio is 55:45 and it will be profitable for you to call. Hopefully that helps you see the connection of how all this is related. It's really just different ways of looking at the same thing, but some things are in $, some are %, some are ratios--you just have to be sure that you're comparing like things. Sometimes you may want to know that you expect to earn $20 on average by making this call or else you may want to know what % of equity you need at a minimum to be making a call. The way you calculate things out depends on what question you're really trying to answer. What this number, equity, can be compared to is the amount you're facing to call. In the example where you're facing a bet of $40 then you're looking at a breakeven situation where your expectation is $0. Your expectation, or Expected Value (EV) is the average profit or loss you may encounter. It is also measured in dollars and you want it to be positive. In this situation, if your chance of winning is 45% then your equity will be $45. Compare that number to the amount you'd have to put in ($45 - $40) and you end up with a positive expectation of $5. In other words, you'll win $5 dollars on average for this hand. Equity is measured in dollars (or chips or whatever currency) and can thus be compared to a similarly measured number, namely the amount you're facing to call. Using the same example as above, say that after you've made a call, the final pot is $100. You believe your probability of winning is 40%. Then your probability of winning (40%) can be multiplied by the whole pot ($100) to get your equity, which will be $40. [Yes, this is the same as ((40% * the pot of $60) + (40% of your call of $40))--simple distributive property--the end result is the same no matter how the money got into the final pot]
