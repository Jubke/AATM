Caecilius checks it back, which is pretty standard with bottom pair. Even though some protection would be nice, especially without a heart in your hand, on a flop this wet. You are incredibly vulnerable for check-raises. Therefore you should be checking most of your bottom pairs here. I think he played his hand completely fine. 

Flop comes 5♥8♥6♣, BrynKenney checks the big blind and I like this play. Although there isn't really a pre-flop aggressor, BrynKenney will be checking it over to caecilius on most of the flops. Betting with Q7 doesn't really make a lot of sense. Q high has showdown value, you have the backdoor flush draw and an open-ended straight draw, so a lot of equity, but just not enough to get it all-in at this SPR. Getting raised after you bet the flop just really sucks and by checking BrynKenney avoids this situation. Q7 is for sure good enough to check call. On the flop and turn in every hand you have to have a raise range with both very strong hands and bluffs that have equity. I think on the flop you are too deep to check-raise. If the chips go in, you are committed, but always behind. It is not a good spot. A better hand to choose would be 98 without a flush draw, for example. Where you could still fold to a reshove. I think 88maca88 bets too small. What hands is NastyMinder really going to fold here? Maybe JT, QT, QJ will find a fold, but even these hands I think can find a call on the flop. 88maca88 should definitely fire at least 200k to take it down sometimes or get some real value. 

Simple question. Simple answer. You should never fold kings here. I have no info on payouts and stacksizes of the other players, but I ran this spot on ICMizer calculating your 'chip ev'. In this spot you should push TT+ and AK. KK is expected to net you 11BB or 44k chips. Which is 80% of your stack. Easiest shove ever. This spot is not even close. Folding is a big big mistake.
