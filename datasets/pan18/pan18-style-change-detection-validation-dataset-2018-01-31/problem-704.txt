what is synchronized with what.. whether it is DB state that will come to memory by querying or memory state will be copied to Db ? I have this code to generate class dynamically and load it how to overcome, googling didnt work? I have configured SSL with glassfish V3 i have followed this http://javadude.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/getting-started-with-glassfish-v3-and-ssl/ but now on console i am getting following exception constantly but on front end it works fine. i tried taking a servlet that will resolve all request and it will parse and then will dispatch the request to prefered servlet,but problem is it goes in loop as again it resolves to the same controller servlet, Consider the case of blogspot.com the domain is the one blogspot.com only but suppose i register in it with xxx then i will have xxx.blogspot.com like wise here it won't be the subdomain (i can smell) , but its some thing different ... how to achieve this ?? in j2ee web application.. i want a mechanism in my web app as described below: The data will be synchronized (but not committed) when session.flush() is called Optionally you should choose Switch Case where ever possible user will enter mydomain.com/CompanyName , depending upon the CompanyNameit will show its logo and its customized page, and i will take that parsed parameter in session again upon each request i will compare the parsed CompanyName and one stored in session , and if they matched then application will show the requested page with user's data.else it will be redirected to login page. and the main thing is i want this thing in JSF arch. I have unlimited strength JCE policies installed with JRE that is causing this, it works without that so OSX and CentOS difference is gone, How can I still make it work ? if you are using extracted tomcat then, SEVERE: ProtocolChain exception java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: CipherSuites may not be null at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.CipherSuiteList.(CipherSuiteList.java:58) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.setEnabledCipherSuites(SSLEngineImpl.java:1696) at com.sun.grizzly.filter.SSLReadFilter.newSSLEngine(SSLReadFilter.java:358) what exactly makes this increase in heap as it loads more classes into Metaspace ? I have data structured in Binary tree format, i want to represent it into an image(*. jpeg) then i need to display that image on web page and all the data will come @ runtime, so image processing should be done @ runtime, how to do this ? This is what my thought solution any other suitable solution are also welcomed, web site is in .NET , i am thinking to produce image using java api then integrate it to .NET wither through WEB-SERVICE call or any other solutions are also welcomed. So, what is the reason behind this decision? I made the following "simulation": So, why doesn't Java have its own defaults - UTF-8, GMT, en_US (yes, I'm on non-en_US locale, but having it as default is fine). Applications could read the system settings via some API, if needed. I think a newer version of hibernate (supporting JPA 2.0) should handle this. But otherwise you can work it around by annotating the collection fields with: Collection literals were scheduled for Java 7, but didn't make it in. So nothing automatic yet. However, I want to initialize them eagerly - i.e. whenever the container starts-up. How is this achieved (in JBoss in particular) Thus programs would be more predictable. EJBs seem to be loaded lazily - whenever accessed. Now, I know one should be careful with these settings, but are easy to miss, hence make programs more error-prone. The simple name of an array is the simple name of the component type with "[]" appended. In particular the simple name of an array whose component type is anonymous is "[]". I've looked at Mongoid(in rails), and morphia(in Java), not found the answer. My server and client programs are both extremely simple. And when to use static methods? Or just avoid using it as much as possible? We are using "TDD" in our development, so the testability of a class often is the most important concern for us. ReentrantReadWriteLock has a fair and non-fair(default) mode, but the document is so hard for me to understand it. And I just replace the word "functional" with "stateless" in the first sentence since the that's real what I meant. (OS: windows xp sp3, java: jdk1.6u27) It seems impossible to create such a method, thank you all very much! How can I understand it? It's great if there is some code example to demo it. I have searched for this, but unfortunately, I don't get the correct answer. And my computer is AMD Athlon X2 4000+, 4G DDR2 667 ram, with windows xp sp3. The server and client programs were both on my own computer, a single computer. The network card will limit the speed or not? Suppose I have some objects in MongoDB: But if the "import" statements in the java file contain "*", that will be a problem: My friend said it was slow, and should be faster. But I don't know how can I improve them, or is there any other libraries I can try to get a better speed?
