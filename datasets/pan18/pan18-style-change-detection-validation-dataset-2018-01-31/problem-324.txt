On the turn if you don't hit you are now 37:9 so call up to 4:1 At this point you cannot really expect to get more on the river if you hit If you are not getting 4:1 on the turn then fold Don't bet out - only call up to 4:1 

I think you played fine. Villain had nothing and you got him to pay off 0.46 on the river. 

On the flop I would have bet out like 1/2 the pot hoping he has a pair and to fold out the straight draw (KQ J9). If you get raised then you need to consider you may be behind. If you get smooth called then bet out again on the turn and river with 1/2 the pot sized bets. But this is about slow play. 

Hit or miss the flush if your opponent checks the turn do exactly what you did the round before. If you bet 1/4 representing a made hand then absolutely do it again. If you do hit on the river you don't want to give any indication you were on a draw. 

You want a big pot but you also want to isolate. Aces is different than lower pairs as it is likely to hold up even if it does not improve against a single opponent. If aces don't improve against multiple players then you are likely to lose. A pair of fives is looking to catch a set so it does not want to isolate. Release fives if you don't hit a set on the flop. 

Let say that flop was KJ3 you still like your hand but there maybe slow play to get all the chips in and take your chances. Here if you lead out on the flop and get raised you don't really know where you stand. You could get raised by a pair of Kings. If they had trip K or J they would slow play you.
