If not a stiff chain then more likely a worn chain and or cassette/freewheel. When they are worn they don't match up well and can jump. Rear wheel first the font is pulled into alignment and front steers so the front (can be) in alignment when the wheel touches even if the bike is not yet in alignment. Also legs are longer and stronger than arms to absorb the shock and can stay in position on the bike. Even if you are way rear wheel early you can shift weight forward and your body is in a position to absorb the landing. 

I own two CX and two mountain. I ride 3 miles to the park for some technical riding the CX kills the mountain. Most of a technical ride is not technical and the CX dominates. In the highly technical sections yes the CX is slower but I can typically still ride the section. At a slow speed 5 mph versus 3 mph is still just 2 mph over short period of time. On the road the CX has 3-5 mph advantage the whole time (even with knobby on the CX). You will typically see downhill riders on full suspension. 

Most likely duplicate but I cannot find it. 

The carbon just plain rides and performs nicer When you land you tend to go out the front rather than the back. 

You can get a relative cheap tool to check for chain stretch. If the chain is stretched then replace it. Cassette/freewheel is a little harder to measure wear - I bring up a picture of a new one and compare. Or just buy a new one and compare. Or just post a picture of it in you question. If you replace the cassette/freewheel then always replace the chain. You can get like 2-3 chains per cassette. You should accept the answer from OJS but this is too much for a comment.
