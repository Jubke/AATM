In referencing actions taken by FDR to limit the immigration of Germans, Italians, and Japanese, he opened himself up to a connection to the Japanese internment. Past that, there are current Treaties and other associated agreements between these US and other nations regarding immigration policies. It would take an act of Congress, adjusting legislation, to modify who is allowed into these United States.

In discussions with individuals that are opposed to Same-Sex marriage, the typical argument raised in objection to the Equal Protections Clause is that Same Sex marriages is beyond the scope of the 14th Amendment. The premise of this argument is that the 14th Amendment deals solely with the rights that had been denied to the formal enslaved persons, and ensuring that they are now treated fairly. From here, the claim is that the Supreme Court committed an overreach of their Constitutional authority, constituting attempts at creating legislation.

This rule making is empowered by "enabling legislation" following acts passed by Congress. In a rule fight between the United States Code and the Code of Federal Regulations, the USC wins.
