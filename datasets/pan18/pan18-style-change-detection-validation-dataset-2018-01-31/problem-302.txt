As a beginner it is not bad to play as the decisions are easier. 

NOT hands you play short stacked. If they show you a card that makes no sense with that ace then they are just plain stupid or they were playing a wild hand and want a call. It is much different than a card you happened to see - it is a card they wanted you to see. 

It is not strictly illegal. There is online poker in New Jersey and it has generated a lot of tax revenue. I think same in LA and Nevada. You must be a resident of the state. 

IANAL but gambling has to be legal in your state and the state gambling commission must approve online gambling. Gambling across state lines is an interstate commerce thing. 

Pre TT is a good hand I wold not limp open. It is not a good enough hand to slow play. You need to fold out hands like ace rag, KQ, KJ and QJ. Come in for like 3 BB or your standard open raise. 

it does not match the combinations number of 2 card combinations = combin(52,2) = 1326 number of way to take three hands = combin(1326, 3) = 387,700,300 number pairs for each rank = combin(4,2) = 6 number of rank = 13 6 x 13 = 78 number of combin(78,3) = 76076 76076 / 387,700,300 = 0.000196224 = 5097 : 1 Not hitting twice in a row 44.44% Card Rank Rank is Ace through 2. Ace highest and 2 lowest. Confusing that cards and hands both use the term rank. 

If you are playing a home game you can run the board multiple time to reduce variance. 6 Three of a kind A♠A♣A♥T♣8♠ Three cards of the same rank. Odds: 46.3 : 1 Announced: X trip or X set or Three of kind X 

Odds Number of hands to play so get the hand. The :1 counts. So 99:1 is 1 in 100 hands. These odds are based on 5 random cards (not best 5 of 7). I like these more in a tournament as you can put your money is situations where you are pretty sure you are ahead. Daniel Negreanu plays these type of hands. A weak home game that does not raise much pre misses even seeing straight draws then very playable.
