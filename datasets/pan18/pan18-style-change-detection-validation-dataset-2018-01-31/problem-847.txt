Thus, the mathematical proof regarding the truth of G relies on assumptions. The basic assumption of the above proof is the soundness of the system F with regards to the natural numbers : a condition that is stronger than consistency. There are theories that are consistent but unsound; a simple example is : F ∪ {¬G}. 

Then ¬G is false; so, by soundness of F : F ⊬ ¬G. 

1st premise) ∀y ¬∃x [Body(x) & Force(y) & Contrary-to-Inertia(y) & Possess(x,y)] 

Newton's theory is that colours are not properties of things; they are the way we "perceive" wave-lenght, which is an "intrinsic" property of light: I do not agree on statements like : [page 3] Another property of matter is impenetrability, which is so characteristic of bodies that many philosophers have not hesitated to make it, together with extension, the essence of body. Indeed, no thing that has extension but lacks impenetrability can be considered a body. For Marcus Aurelius' "background" can be useful to see Epictetus. 3) ¬ [Body(x) & Force(Thought) & Contrary-to-Inertia(Thought) & Possess(x,Thought)] 

2nd premise) Force(Thought) & Contrary-to-Inertia(Thought) Comment: see the discussion [page 5] about "the force of attraction — with which bodies are endowed, in the opinion of English philosophers [the Newtonians] — can easily be disproven." Gravitation is not, according to Euler, an intrinsic property of matter but must be explained in some way: either mechanically (see the Cartesian vortex theory) or by intervention of some external "active power", like in Leibniz. "Grasping a Thought" (or a sense) is a sort of "primitive" in Frege's philosophy; it is a basic assumption that is not analyzed further. You can see Stoic Philosophy of Mind: 

In the Gibbs Lecture, thus, Gödel acknowledged that [his theorems] do not rule out the existence of an algorithmic procedure (a computing machine, an automated theorem prover) equivalent to the mind in the relevant sense [...]. However, if such a procedure existed “we could never know with mathematical certainty that all the propositions it produce[d were] correct.” Consequently, it may well be the case that “the human mind (in the realm of pure mathematics) [is] equivalent to a finite machine that … is unable to understand completely its own functioning”: a machine too complex to analyze itself up to the point of establishing the correctness of its own procedures. Gödel inferred that what follows from the incompleteness results is, at most, a disjunctive conclusion:
