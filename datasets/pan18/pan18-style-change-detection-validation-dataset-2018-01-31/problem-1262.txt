/ˌɐˈʔɐ/ [ˌʔɐˈʔɐ] uh-uh, distinct from /ˌɐˈhɐ/ [ˌʔɐˈhɐ] uh-huh. Japanese accent patterns are generally based on phrasal units, which are generally longer than a single morpheme (for example phrase-ending particles are included). Therefore I'm suspicious of the claim that there's a distinction between /VV/ (within a morpheme) and /V V/ (across morphemes) when the accent pattern of the constituent morphemes is the same. In the standard (Moscow-based) Russian accent, five vowels /i　e　a　o　u/ are distinguished in stressed syllables, but at most three /ɪ~ɨ　ɐ~ə　ʊ/ in unstressed syllables. /i　e/ reduce to /ɪ/, /a　o/ to /ɐ/, and /u/ to /ʊ/. Russian also has word-final obstruent devoicing and assimilation of voicing and palatalization. Russian orthography is roughly morphophonemic. Examples: French petit 'small': orthographic ⟨petit⟩, phonetic [pɵt̪ʲi], phonemic /pəti/, morphophonemic //pətit// In addition to slashes and square brackets, sometimes also used are double-slashes, pipes, and angle brackets. Their uses are: Indicates a transcription that records the phones (speech sounds) that are spoken, without attempting to classify them into phonemes. The amount of phonetic detail transcribed can vary; the example here is a fairly narrow (detailed) transcription. A broader transcription might be [ˈkʰæts]. Many dictionaries use /ʌ/ in stressed position and /ə/ in unstressed positions. So we get transcriptions such as: The only discussion of the topic I found online so far is on this forum. There's also, to some extent, the Talk section about the ARPAbet article on Wikipedia. The reason I'm asking is because I'm teaching American English with a lot of phonemic transcriptions – why teach two phonemes when there's only one. This leaves us with two problems: As I see it, there's only one phoneme here, which happens to be realized [ʌ] in stressed position and as a schwa [ə] in unstressed positions. Finally, where would professional linguists locate those sounds on the following chart (again, from an American point of view)? What case can be made for considering whether [ə] and [ʌ] are different phonemes or not in American English? Please note the focus is on standard American English. EDIT: i.e.: on General American. I cannot think of a single minimal pair to contrast /ə/ and /ʌ/. Problem 2 : if they are allophones, which notation should be used for the phoneme? I assume /ə/. Now to the main part of the question: are there processes which tend towards being surface true? Probably the more fruitful way of asking the question is: which types of processes will tend to result in opacity? (you will get more hits if you search for opacity in google) When you have opacity, there are two interacting processes, such that one of them covers up the conditioning environment of the other (see Bakovic 2011's citation of Kiparsky 1973 (which is notoriously difficult to find) for a clearer definition). If one of these was nasal place assimilation, then we would find rule-conditioned homorganic nasal-obstruent sequences alongside non-homorganic nasal-obstruent sequences. Gussenhoven & Jacobs (1998: 55) "The term phoneme is used to refer to the segment category that the various allophones are variants of." Ladefoged (ms.) "Perhaps the most startling conspiracy — one that seems to have deceived by far the majority of linguists — is the appearance of phonemes. Accounts of human behavior in terms of phonemes are nearly always examples of what has been called the psychologist's fallacy — the notion that because an act can be described in a given way that it is necessarily structured in that way. As will be shown later, phoneme size units play only a minor role in human behavioral acts such as normal speaking and listening. They are, nevertheless, great imaginary objects for use in describing linguistic aspects of speech."
