Five are the acts of fitra: circumcision, removing the pubes, clipping the moustache, cutting the nails, plucking the hair under the armpits. But any other of the 4 Sunni Madhabs would say a wali is necessary for any marriage according to the following Hadith and Athar Note: If it is necessary this post can be divided into two separate questions (I hope for some constructive comments).
