So you essentially did miss the main point of the categorical imperative in your paraphrase. I excuse myself for not knowing the quality of the translation in the electronic copy I have got at hand from the University of Adelaide, Australia. Arguments Regarding direct quote from the Critique of Judgement Kant used the intuitive understanding as a limiting concept [Grenzbegriff] to understandings like ours and always disjunctive to it, like the holy will vs. a finite (albeit, in abstraction, pure) will like ours in his practical philosophy. From the Critique of Judgement, ยง77, paragraph no. 8 (Ak. 407.13-408.23, quoting the paragraph as a whole, bolded by me), Cambridge Edition: In a second step, considering these two aspects, we will see wether there 

But I think questions on good commentaries on the respective critiques can either be already found (CPR here and CPoJ here) or should be asked seperately. Your examples I would argue that you examples are not proper maxims at all, and that's why it is hard to universalise them per application of the Categorical Imperative. They lack situational and intentional dimensions. As @MauroAllegranza pointed out in the comments, Meillassoux additionally claims to have a "homologous procedure" in "proving" his cogito, i.e. a sceptical search for necessary and universal truth. 

But YES, there has to be "an affinity" between morality and beauty. Actually, Kant states in the quote (which I edited into the question, admittedly) that the positivity (and feeling of universalisability) of the feeling of beauty actually is grounded in it being the symbol of morality. First section First step: Lawfulness of the will The first step is both in the first and the second section to bring lawfulness into play. This is where the arguments differ the most, out of reasons that are not possible to include into this answer, because they are not obvious or trivial (Oh what is in Kant?!).
