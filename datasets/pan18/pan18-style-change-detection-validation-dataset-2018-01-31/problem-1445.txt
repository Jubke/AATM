To make us prepared for what God is intending to give In the section of filial piety in prayer, CCC #2737 talks about why we don't immediately receive what we ask for and quotes St. Augustine (b. 334–d. 440) in a passage that is relevant for this as well: 

"Blessed one" in the last line is a reference to Luke 1:48: "For he has looked upon his handmaid’s lowliness; / behold, from now on will all ages call me blessed." This verse was also cited in the CCC and Lumen gentium. 

107 Cf. Mt 6:10,33; Lk 11:2,13. 108 Cf. Acts 6:6; 13:3. 109 Cf. Rom 10:1; Eph 1:16-23; Phil 1:9-11; Col 1:3-6; 4:3-4,12. 

Many Old Testament figures led lives that are comparable to modern day saints. Yet none of them seem to be given the title of "Saint". Why is this? 

To express our desire and search for the Kingdom of God We are desiring and searching ourselves for the Kingdom of God, and our petitions should be for things that will help in that. Long answer Let's start by working backwards from the Catechism of the Catholic Church (which does a decent job of sourcing its theology). All bolded text is my own emphasis. 

Say that a couple was married despite an impediment, which is usually justification for annulment. Some examples of impediments include: So it's clear from the Catholic Church's lack of scripture on these points in their official doctrines that there is no biblical basis for Mary having the title "Mother of God". 

To give us hope in our lamentation, and to receive help in our other prayers By asking God for things, we are provided hope from our struggles. Additionally, the Holy Spirit helps us to pray both in petition and other types of prayers. 

A few sections after the one you mentioned is an explanation of the devotion of to Mary. CCC §971 explains why she is considered blessed, and why she is given the title "Mother of God" 

(21) Sub tuum praesidium 301 Lk. 1:48. 302 Cf. Col. 1:15-16. 303 Col 1:19. 

Short answer There is no usage of the title "Mother of God" in the Bible. The title was used for Mary as early as AD 250-280 and was made official church teaching at the Council of Ephesus in 431. Advocates wanted to use that title, as opposed to the alternative "Mother of Christ", to affirm the doctrine of Incarnation (that Jesus Christ is the second person in the Trinity), which has its own biblical basis (e.g. John 1). In other words, the title "Mother of God" is less about Mary and more about Jesus' divinity.
