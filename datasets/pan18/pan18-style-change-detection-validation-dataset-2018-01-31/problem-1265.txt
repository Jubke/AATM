In sum, I think a preliminary to this task is to try to clarify the positions of the antisegmentalists (admittedly not an easy task) and determine exactly at what points these vary from those of segmentalists. It tends to be the case that many arguments put forward on either side are against positions which are not held by anyone, and defenses against such arguments are defenses of positions which were never attacked. The strong segmentalist view propounded by Chomsky in the 1960's and still by Halle is that phonological representations are matrices, where each column represents a segment. Arguments about the autosegmental nature of tone and accent have made this position difficult to adhere to. The more reasonable segmentalist position today is that phonological representations are made of timing nodes which are linked to different universal features. The timing slots correspond to segments. The argument made by Lodge (in his 2009 book "Fundamental concepts in phonology") is that the features are not universal, and can therefore be assigned an arbitrary phonetic interpretation. He does not, however, argue that phonological representations lack any sort of timing tier. His model of phonology still requires timing nodes, but varies from generativist work in rejecting the universality of features. Silverman (in his 2006 book "A Critical Introduction to Phonology") brings up external evidence against features, citing a well-known 1979 Study by Morais et al (Cognition 7:(4) 323-331) showing that Portuguese illiterates were unable to perform a task requiring them to add or subtract a segment to/from the beginning of a word. As far as I can tell, there is no opponent of segments who would argue that phonological words are always stored, perceived and produced as indivisible wholes, but this would be a good artificial endpoint to set in evaluating different proposals. First, concerning how some of these data will be analyzed in OT. In "classical" OT, markedness constraints were only evaluated on surface representations, and faithfulness constraints were only evaluated on pairs of input/output representations. As it turns out, the analysis of reduplication is one area that led to the development of different types of faithfulness constraints. Correspondence Theory (McCarthy & Prince 1995) generalizes the notion of faithfulness constraints, so that they can apply to other types of pairing, including Base/Reduplicant. In Alderete et al (1999) you can find a discussion of how IO and BR faithfulness constraints can interact to account for differing phonotactic characteristics in Reduplicants versus in other parts of the language. 

Ladefoged "Vowels and Consonants" (2001: 193--4) "If we are thinking in acoustic terms, even ? is not so far from t. On a spectrogram both correspond to very similar gaps in the pattern. Linguists have a term for a group of similar sounds of this kind. They call it a phoneme...We talk of the difference between kit and pit being the use of the phoneme /k/ as opposed to the phoneme /p/. There is usually no harm in expressing htings this way. But it is important to remember that it is a kind of shorthand. A phoneme is not a single sound but a group of sounds.
