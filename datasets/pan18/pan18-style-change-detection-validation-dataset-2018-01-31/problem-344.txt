Flop That is a very strong board. 2 pair is great. You could be against AQ AT KJ but you are likely good. AA, QQ, TT would have seen more action pre flop. Two draws you don't have a piece of and in everyone's range. SB could be on a flush or straight draw. Maybe a hand like AJ. You want to protect your 2 pair but a raise is expensive and if you get one call then a draw will be priced in to call. Most states don't allow gambling and you could have the same argument of jobs and tax revenue. Gambling is not widely accepted as a positive contribution to society (in the USA). Let's say you had A-J suited in that position in an un-raised pot. Then maybe a min raise to build pot equity. A big bet to get the table to fold is still risky with 4 players to act behind you that could have you dominated. On the button with no one in the pot your chance of being dominated goes in 1/2. Exactly what you should do with any particular M at any particular point in a tournament varies widely, depending on other factors such as other players M's, players left in the tournament, players tendencies Etc. M in itself, is just a simple scoring system, a sort of short hand for discussing tournament tactics. Rather then going through player A had 100, T-chips, I had 20 t-chips the blinds were 5-10, one can discuss it like I had 1.5 M, villain had about 7 M at the final table were the average was about 5 M. 

At higher stakes the players are better. It is natural for everybody to have smaller relative win rates. $5/$10 to $10/$20 4.50% $3.00 0.1 Your particular M compared to other players in the tournament is a pretty good benchmark about how well your doing in a tournament. Of course the practicality of figuring every players M is a little tough, until the tournament is down to a few tables.
