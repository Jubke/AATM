If you have players that will randomly go in then take a stand with a hand that will beat a random hand. 42 off suite beats 72 off suite but that is about it. 42 off suite is one of worse possible starting hands. Don't call if you can't even beat a bluff. If you want to gamble then pick a hand like 78 suited or 33 as you are a dog but you have a lot more ways to win - you still should not call two (even one) all-in with it. Two players in the pot then even if it is a bluff let them battle it out. 

K8 does not steal 4567 as A2 does not have a piece of it As for you assumption. Really, made it to the final table 4 handed and on the button will only raise with AA KK? That is one tight player. 

What about your odds based on you know you don't have a flush card bet / pot = 9 / 26 = 35% You actually want to bet a little more than 1/3 the pot to get them to decide to come off the pot They are (typically) better off than they think they are 

On the flop you have to put AQ in his range. He called a raise pre-flop. River Trip fives is a nice hand here but it is not getting called by a worse hand with an over bet. A small bet might get a call from a pair but it opens you up to a bluff. An 8 should have bet the flop and an over pair would have raised pre. Just check it back and it sucks you take down a small pot with bottom trips. Good bluff by BrynKenney but caecilius put himself in a spot to be bluffed. Bryn could have been up against a flush or straight so I think he put too much at risk to take down a small pot. Yes I think you fold here.
