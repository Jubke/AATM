After fixing the torque values, a week passed and now the creaking is just a memory. Next I tried drilling with a dremmel. The bolt is in the bottom of the front triangle, so even though I used a flexible arm (like the ones at the dentist's), I was unable to attack the screw co-axially and the drill bit constantly hit against the aluminum frame. 

After tightening it a lot*, another week passed and my non-drive side crankarm fell off. I tightened it a lot after that. So, firstly I tried to burn a slot in the body of the screw with a heated screwdriver. I got it several millimeters deep, but when I attempted to turn, half of the screw broke off. I have an external bearing BB, that I need replaced (It is quite badly rusted). I opt to do the repair myself. The bike is a Specialized Hardrock, the crank arms are SR Suntour. The source of the problem was that the plastic body of the screw threads difficultly into the thread. The feeling is comparable to those metal bolts with rubber seal to prevent vibration. 

The old hub has 24 spokes. The disc rotor is attacked via 6 bolts. Then I installed my octalink crankarms, but lost the washer between the non-drive side fixing bolt and the crank arm. 

If needed, I will post a photo tonight. Just ask in the comments! I never owned a stand, and don't have the space for one in my apartment. Plus I prefer to do it in the park in clear air with a beer in hand. Having done everything possible, I inserted a steel screw and tried to chase the thread with it. To my disappointment, it didn't work. The "nipple" at the frame began rotating, with respect to the frame. The bolt become stuck within the "nipple". Now I need to go to a LBS and ask if they could replace the thing. 

Page five lists 700C as french marking for 28". Be sure to read their preceding discussion, where they explain that correspondences are somewhat arbitrary and it is not impossible for 28" tyres to not fit perfectly on your rims (your dealer was probably correct).
