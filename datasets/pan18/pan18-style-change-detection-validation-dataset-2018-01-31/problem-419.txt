Have I committed a sin because I didn't know? - you probably did not make sin neither by your behavior, because, even if it was incorrect behviour, as soon as you did not know, you are not sinful for your that behaviour, and you are not probably sinful for not knowing that at first place because that is quite advanced topic and you could not know so much things, and also it is probably even a disagreement among different islamic scholars, so several different resulting opinions looks quite right do different scholars and you need to know quite much to have your own opinion.

Provided he be a person acquainted with the form of invocation, whether man or woman, infant or idiot. THE Zabbah is lawful provided the slayer be acquainted with the form of the Tasmeea, or invocation in the name of GOD, the nature of Zabbah, and the method of cutting the veins of the animal ; and it signifies not whether the person be a man or a woman, an infant or an idiot, a circumcised person or an uncircumcised.
