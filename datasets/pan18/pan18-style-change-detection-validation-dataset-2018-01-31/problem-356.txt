The first thing you need to bare in mind is that Allah is the most forgiving and he is capable of forgiving any sin as long as repentance was a sincere one: 

Although sincere repentance may cause your sins to be forgiven, it isn't an easy task to attempt to remain stead fast on the righteous path and avoid sins: 

Changing the environment your in and those around you that have a bad influence on you is essential for you to remain a righteous person: 

Your employer has no right to prevent you from doing this and in many countries (even non-muslim countries) this is considered as discremenation in the work place therefore know your rights and excersise them if not find a new employer and Allah will help you in the process: 

Life is a struggle and one should remain strong throughout their, one cannot achieve this by their own rather by supplicating to God and relying on him after you have done all that you could possibly do: 

Now according to comment of ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani in fath al-Bari (on Sahih al-Bukhari) there are three different aspects which have been discussed by scholars on this hadith: 

Some scholars or madhabs say it is ok saying your niyyah to remind yourself, but saying (reading) it can become an issue, as once you start saying you may make things more complex than they are: For example you want to pray 'Isha': In your mind after performing your ablution (wudu') you might go to a mosque (with the intention to pray), once at the mosque you might join the congregation (with the intention to pray in a congregation and gain the rewards). Now it can become excessively complex if you follow some guide lines of some madhabs, for example they say you must fully express you niyya, that means you might say to yourself, I'm intending to pray the 'isha' (fard) in 4 raka'a with this (following the) Imam in congregation, so here many mistakes can appear, for example instead you say you'll pray 'asr or forget one of those expression parts, but is that really a correct niyyah or did the Propeht () do so? No a niyyah by definition is the intention to do an act at the very beginning of it, so it is basically a simple thought of the kind "Hey I'll do that now for the sake of Allah" followed by "Allahu akbar" (the takbir to start in the example of a prayer). And if the Propeht () would have done it this way he would have thought it to the sahaba and we should have narrations supporting that.
