Other examples of this include 1 Cor 12:4–6, 2 Cor 13:14, Eph 4:4–6, and 1 Peter 1:2. Sproul adopts a Platonic understanding of essence, as opposed to existence, saying that essence: the heathen gods, as the heathen understand them, do not exist, and the supernatural beings (angels and demons) that do exist and are called "gods" are not divine at all: they are creatures, created by the one true God. nam unde poterant innumerabilia saecula praeterire quae ipse non feceras, cum sis omnium saeculorum auctor et conditor? aut quae tempora fuissent quae abs te condita non essent? aut quomodo praeterirent, si numquam fuissent? cum ergo sis operator omnium temporum, si fuit aliquod tempus antequam faceres caelum et terram, cur dicitur quod ab opere cessabas? idipsum enim tempus tu feceras, nec praeterire potuerunt tempora antequam faceres tempora. Dating the work is difficult, but this chronology suggests the ~AD 215 timeframe. Also available in Ante-Nicene Fathers, Volume 4 Philip Schaff, Creeds of Christendom, Volume 2, p55. Dialogue with Trypho in Ante-Nicene Fathers, Volume 1, pg 213 English text is from the Dods translation of the City of God and the Chadwick translation of the Confessions. Latin text is from the City of God and the Confessions on the Latin Library. 1 Corinthians 8:6 (NASB) yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist through Him. I posit that "rest" here means something like "at rest" (i.e. an object that is not moving) as opposed to relaxing or sleeping. He "rested" because he had (v2) "completed His work which He had done" and there was nothing left to do. He "ceased" from working because his work was finished. God is One Critics of trinitarianism will point to there being almost no mention of any "persons of the Godhead" in the Old Testament (exceptions: Ge 1:26, Ge 11:7), and many instances of there being only one God. They will describe the three "persons" of the Trinity as being three separate gods because they are not a single, identical individual. If we accept this (unproven here) conclusion, then God gave humans free will in order that they might be capable of genuinely loving him. True love is voluntary, so in order for us to be capable of loving God, we also had to be capable of something else, including rebellion/sin. God must want us to increase in virtue, so whatever acts make us increase the most align us best on the path to seek the will of God. St. Thomas Aquinas - On the Trinity and the Incarnation Chapter 39 So, Trinity and the Incarnations require more than complicated Venn Diagrams to explain. The abbot concluded that they were all of them correct, but felt there must be a deeper mystery connecting the three findings. He never was able to find out what it was but he did come to a deeper understanding of God. The novena was to consist of being assigned one freshly minted hydrogen atom (a New Atom, if you will) and contemplating it, mediating on its mysteries. Then they were to report their findings to the abbot. +-----------------+   (Incarnation)
