It may somehow based upon memes (parentood, compromise, orderliness, etc) but it is a 'memetic organism' not just a collection or network of memes like a belief system. There is more to it. It is a specific solution, crafted to leverage those memes. It is more like what your body is to your genes, than what the genes are themselves. 

I do think that it is unethical to pump up romance unnecessarily. Especially since this is generally done for others' personal gain. Romance is an industry in this culture, and it preys upon a part of the population with a specific weakness that makes them rather impractical to begin with, the young adult. (One way of looking at Borderline structure to begin with is that it is unfortunately extended adolescence.) 

But traditional ontology tends to want to support both realistic and idealist positions, to some degree. So it avoids explicitly letting logic be reduced to linguistics or philology. Traditionally, the people looking at these issues have always preferred to handle language in terms of other intuitions, and to reify imaginary ideals, rather than relying on actual acts of interaction or processing. We want a model that feels like mathematics, because then we can correctly layer our sciences, and have a single most basic kind of belief, that springs entirely from intuition. Mathematics requires that any solution should be expressible in terms of imaginary objects alone. 

Why does such an extremely weird universe exist? This is beyond “quantum mechanics” weirdness, it is unacceptable weirdness. 

IMHO humans seem to suffer from an intense obsession to construct a world view, which can give us a satisfying cosmology, i.e. which can give a good answer to ‘The One Question’, the question of “arche” (ἀρχή): 

No, it obviously doesn't work that way. 1 and 2 do not beget infinity. 

Superficially it would not change much, except our attitude to free will, perhaps. So, why again, do atheists take it so serious? 

Theism, of course, is also a world view which at least gives us the illusion to answer ‘The One Question’. 

for every natural number n, P being true for n implies that P is true for n + 1, 

As you noticed, a relation r: X → Y is about "twoness". After all, it is formally defined as a subset of the Cartesian product X × Y = {(x, y): x ∈ X, y ∈ Y}. 

And if we look at the natural numbers there is one important axiom, the axiom of mathematical induction: 

Substance dualism as defined by you (the OP) doesn't guarantee even the one important thing, which would be persistence of the self after death. 

But if we look just at Westerners, we get a different picture. So we must ask ourselves: What (in the West – for now on) makes (substance) dualism and atheism seem so incompatible? Why do atheism and materialism seem to go hand in hand? Why are nearly all prominent atheists also materialists? 

If 1 and 2 are the basic concepts of mind, what difference is there between a child, that can count to two, and a great mathematician? That the great mathematician can juggle much better with 1s and 2s? 

But knowledge is specific to the mind. It is etymologically related to recognition, not storage. It bears the sense of internal perception. To know something is to have the emotional impression of having it, and having impressions or perceptions cause recognition of it, bringing it out of some passive state so that it can be experienced as present in the mind. 

This is disputed at great length, and lied about in Congress and in fiction, but the data are clear. No matter how you abuse or threaten someone, with direct pain, psychological force, threats to loved ones, etc., the primary effect is to garner false information, mostly false confessions or false implications of the guilt of innocent people. 

But the opposite extreme argument, that violence is unnecessary and can be done away with, which is what you presumably want help defending, is also flawed: 

Various things like 'xenophobia', and 'fairness' appear to be 'memes', in that they get taken up by many people in each generation, and persist across time by simply spreading, because they have some kind of intrinsic appeal. But it is hard to think of them as mere illusions. The racial divide itself may be a 'spook', but our reaction to there being a tribal boundary presented to us is visceral. The idea that the world should be fair, when it isn't, has very real physical effects that the 'notion of rights' doesn't have.

But what about atheistic dualism (or atheistic non-materialism)? It fails to answer ‘The One Question’ satisfyingly. In substance dualism we must just take it as a brute fact that two fundamentally different substances exist. Now, why does ‘mind stuff’ exist? Why? Where does it come from? A materialistically conceived evolution surely can't explain it. How can we dare to believe ‘consciousness’ is equally deeply built into the universe as fundamental physical properties, like say, electrical charge or mass? 

By any sane definition (sorry, Hobbes) of the terms, theism is incompatible with materialism. But the reverse is not true, substance dualism and atheism are compatible.
