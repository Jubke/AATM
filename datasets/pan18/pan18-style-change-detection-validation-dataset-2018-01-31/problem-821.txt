This little boy just won't stay put and rolls over onto his tummy within seconds of being laid down. I'm sure you understand the consequences of this when I've just opened up a nice juicy poopy diaper but haven't quite pulled it away yet. Breast Feeding in any manner is a good thing for the both of you. Use the manual pump when you need or want to. This balance is entirely up to you. ANY breast milk is better than none - do what you can and don't stress too much about the rest. Play games like "down by the bay" where you have to come up with sets of words that rhyme to make it funny. There are tons of "games" you can play with words that encourage rhyme like this. Do this in the car or while waiting for an appointment. Do it often. In regard to the tooth decay issue: The following portions of this answer are aimed at helping mom get some social time too(this helps to set a good example, plus even homebody's such as myself need time away from time to time anyway): Because having a relationship with a Dental care professional can be so helpful in a child's dental health and emergence of good habits in this matter the AAPD also recommends finding a "dental home" by the time your child turns one. You aren't at the stage yet, but meeting with a pediatric dentist, may help to put your mind at ease - even now. Second, I would actually suggest reversing your counting. I know it seems like a simple difference and in the end - even to a child it isn't a big difference, but 3,2,1, does actually work better in my experience (preschool teacher and mother of my own). My Child's dentist and hygienist recommended wiping her teeth and gums with a gauze square after each feeding (even the night-time ones) to wipe away the bacteria that cause decay as well as those that cause gingivitis.
