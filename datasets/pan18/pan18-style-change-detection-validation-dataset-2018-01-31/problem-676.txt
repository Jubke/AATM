Originally, Germanic kings were not hereditary rulers at all but were elected among warriors and were therefore necessarily males. As the institution became hereditary, the notion that the king had to be a man remained. But the thing is that while women had a very limited political role in the European Middle Ages, succession through female lines were never strictly excluded. Many European kingdoms then allowed queens to rule themselves (instead of merely transmitting an estate or title to their husband or son). 

Those in favour of a break with the EU often paint a rosy picture in which the UK is able to get what it wants and maintain unfettered access to the single market while sceptics tend to assume that the EU cannot offer to renege on some core principle like the freedom of movement for persons but at this stage it's mostly guesswork (and possibly quite a bit of bluff/wishful thinking on both sides). 

One thing many people do not realise is that the EU is not pushing tons of rules on the smallest things out of mission creep or because German and French bureaucrats have a secret plan to take over the world. Rather, the rules on the shape of cucumbers or any other funny example you might dig up are really a direct result of the single market idea. The goal is to make sure that once a product is fit for consumption and sale in one country, it's automatically accepted in the others, no need to start from scratch with tests, paperwork, etc. 

Access to the single market. It's sometimes difficult to understand what this entails precisely but that's probably the most important realisation of the EU. It's not merely about trade and exports; nowadays, goods flow easily, the external tariff is low and the UK would still sell a lot of the stuff to the EU, no matter what. What this is about are things like technical norms, or certifications and authorisations.
