SOFU would suggest that the Trilogy names form an initialism, which they do not. SOFU is based on all the Trilogy sites starting with the letter "S" followed by either "O", "F", or "U". Software heads recognized this as a regular expression which would be properly written S[OFU]. The term "trilogy" refers to the original three sites in the series. Super User became the fourth site of the "trilogy in four parts," in the tradition of the five books of the Hitchhiker's Trilogy. So "The Trilogy" is a name affectionately applied to the group of sites, making it a proper noun--capitalized. Stack Overflow is not nearly ubiquitous enough to usurp the exclusive use of a noun as a pronoun or a deity. One would not refer to "New Coke" as simply "New." The term must be applied in context to take on its full meaning. About "SO Trilogy": this is wrong but I'm getting tried of writing so let's just cross that off and hope nobody bothered reading this far. The most official looking label is The Stack Overflow Trilogy. And by "official," I mean Really Cool Looking. Unfortunately in legal circles, use of the () symbol means—I appologise in advance for subjecting you to very technical Lawyer Talk—everyone can write "The Stack Overflow Trilogy" except Stack Overflow, Inc. Most changes would be fairly obvious: We prefer this Q&A format over the "forum"-style conversations typically found on the Internet. People who say "this is not a forum" are simply urging users to avoid the patterns that cause traditional forums to fail. Now put down your pencils or you'll poke someone's eye out. Without throwing out a lot of arbitrary, wildly-speculative dates, the best I can say is that localization is slowly creeping up in priority. But there are no dates to report or even an estimate. There are proposals targeted for other languages, but they are created with the understanding that the menus and prompts will all be in English… for the time being. The word thorough would seem to be more fitting here, rather than simply saying the post should contain more words. Not everyone has an intrinsic "right" to be in a conversation. Using a crowd-based chat control, someone repeatedly disrupting the group dynamic can lead to brief timeouts; timeouts lead to blocking; blocking leads to bans. It's all very transparent (by the UI), but that doesn't preclude moderators from jumping in for the occasion "exception handling" (repeated warnings from the group dynamic can eventually escalate to a Moderator, and overtly hostile actions need a swift response). This graph clearly suggests that EE is about to be overtaken. I wonder if their one-year+ "bump" in viewership had anything to do with Stack Overflow? In less than one year, StackOverflow has accumulated 23,305 tags (as of this post). (I hesitate to get into a further implementation conversation here; it will only derail the point of this post) "Light annoyance" isn't generally well-expressed in a chat environment, and it is easily misinterpreted and blown out of proportion. Bringing that disapproving glance into the public conversation can cause a disruptive backlash or trigger a piling-on effect that isn't typically worth raising. That's where the core system can help. Chat in the physical world To me, chat is like the group discussion that congregates spontaneously outside the trade show conference room… or a social gathering which has tapered off into post-occasion hangouts. You don't generally have someone external "in charge" of the conversation, and the party host doesn't usually come running over to tell you every time you're doing it wrong. It all started with Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow grew to the point where it was best to split off into a few specialty sites to cover some of the "softer" topics surrounding programming. But if you have a specific programming problem that involves the actual act of day-to-day coding, your question likely belongs on Stack Overflow. Has all the side discussions that you can get EE answers without paying made them more relevant again? If we take away that little bit of self-identity, you're also removing one of the major purpose-driven motives for using this site… and that would be a disproportionate reaction to allay some momentary irk you assign to something so inconsequential.
