The same Wikipedia article lists 5 players that were ranked No. 1 without having a GS title at the time: Kim Clijsters, Amélie Mauresmo, Jelena Jankovic, Dinara Safina and Caroline Wozniacki. (Clijster and Mauresmo won several GS tournaments, but only after they became No. 1 for the first time.) 

It happens quite often that a tennis tournament is not finished on Sunday. Due to weather or other reason. A few examples (I wanted to include various leves - Grand Slam, ATP Tour, ATP Challenger Tour; I have no doubt that many other examples can be found): 

1) Teams composed of players in either the Emirates ATP Rankings or the Emirates ATP Doubles Rankings. The combined positions of the two players (using best Emirates ATP Rankings (singles or doubles) shall be added together and the total used to determine the direct acceptances. The most recent Emirates ATP Rankings and/or Emirates ATP Doubles Rankings list, including a protected ranking, shall be used. Ties shall be resolved as follows: a) Team using two (2) singles rankings. b) Team using one (1) singles ranking. c) A team using a protected ranking is positioned below the other team(s); if one player on each team is using a protected ranking then the position of each remaining player determines which team is positioned higher. d) For ties between teams with the same composition, priority will be given to the team with the strongest individual Emirates ATP Rankings, including protected ranking, or for teams using two Emirates ATP Doubles Rankings, the fewest number of tournaments played and then the team with the highest number of points. 

From the ATP World Tour website (emphasis mine): The rules changed in 2016. Here is an excerpt from 2016 WTA Official Rulebook (internet archive): 

I do not know whether it is possible to somehow find ranking breakdowns from the past, but according to this blog post Vina del Mar was included on February 11th; but this was before the tournament in Sao Paolo. He had 5550 points on February 11th (after Vina del Mar) and 5755 points on February 18th (after Sao Paolo). 

I do not have any official source but the way I remember it from watching tennis on TV: 

3) ATP Challenger Tour tournaments scheduled the same week as an ATP World Tour tournament may offer wild cards to players positioned 11-50 in the Emirates ATP Rankings who have received approval from the ATP on-site Supervisor according to the following breakdown: $150,000/€127,000 in prize money up to (2) two wild cards $125,000/€106,000 in prize money up to (2) one wild card $100,000/€85,000 in prize money up to (1) one wild card $75,000/€64,000 in prize money plus Hospitality up to (1) one wild card $75,000*/€64,000* in prize money no wild card *Plus Hospitality Most consecutive appearances in Grand Slams My question is what happens during Grand Slams, which last two weeks. Some players do not play at GS tournaments, so they might play some tournament during the first week. However, if the new ranking would be issued after one week of GS tournaments, what should be done? Dropping the points for the last edition of the same GS tournament seems unfair, since the players did not finish the tournament yet? Do players, who represent their countries in Davis Cup/Fed Cup, receive also some points in ATP rankings/WTA rankings? 

I encountered term bagel girl in connection with a tennis player. I understood approximately the meaning of this term from the context, but could some clarify it in more detail? Is there also male equivalent for this colloquial term? For Race to London I get the following: 

NOTE: This cannot be considered as a complete answer, since I wasn't able to find the record for WTA matches and also some sources I found contradict each other. But I am posting at least the information I was able to find, hoping that someone might be able to find the missing info. 

According to the blog Where is the next generation in men’s tennis? (Wayback Machine) written by John Burn-Murdoch (FT Data) in November 2015: The same Wikipedia article also mentions two players who were at No. 1 position without GS title: Marcelo Rios and Ivan Lendl. (Lendl won several Grand Slam tournaments later.) 

Roger Federer 65 (2001 US Open - 2016 Australian Open) Feliciano López 59 (2002 French Open - 2016 US Open) Wayne Ferreira 56 (1991 Australian -2004 US Open) Fernando Verdasco 54 (2003 Wimbledon - 2016 US Open) Stefan Edberg 53 (1983 Wimbledon - 1996 US Open)1 Tomáš Berdych 52 (2003 US Open - 2016 Wimbledon) David Ferrer 50 (2003 Australian Open - 2015 French Open) Novak Djokovic 48 (2005 Australian Open - 2016 US Open) Guillermo García-López 48 (2005 Australian Open - 2016 US Open) Stan Wawrinka 47 (2005 French Open - 2016 US Open) 1Australian Open was not played in 1986. Men Wikipedia article Longest tiebreaker in tennis (current revision) lists 52 points (27-25) from the match between Bury/Kowalczyk and Dasnières de Veigy/Gicquel in the first round of 2012 Marrakech challenger. However, this was at ATP Challenger Tour, not at ATP World Tour level. 

I have noticed that many twitter posts about Petra Kvitová use the hashtag #P3tra. 

Both Wikipedia article and 2014 ATP Rulebook mention additional qualifying points. (For example, 25 points in Grand Slams.)
