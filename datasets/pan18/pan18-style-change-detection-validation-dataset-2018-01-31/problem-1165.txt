The final thing that made this trick work was the German command and control system. The commanders would travel with the Panzers, rather than staying in a distant (and safe) headquarters. This saved a great deal of time needed for communications -- radio usually had to be encrypted Morse Code at the time, handled by specialists, rather than direct speech between commanders and operations officers -- and enabled the Germans to do things much faster than their opponents' command structures could react to them. 

Medical staff were special cases. Female medical, dental and veterinary officers always had full commissions in the men's services. Chaplains were another special case, complicated by different religions' rules on female ministers. Each of the British services also has an associated nursing organisation, whose personnel are mostly female. 

The most dangerous of the early-war British anti-tank weapons was probably the "Sticky Bomb", which tried to glue a powerful explosive charge to a tank, with a five-second delay fuse for the user to take cover. It was replaced later in the war by the Gammon Bomb, which was still pretty dangerous, but was used to kill several tanks in Normandy. 

Going through the lists of US military awards for ones he might have been eligible for, I'm not finding anything: 

The Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal required three consecutive years of good conduct at the time. He would not have had it: he did not serve for three years, and while he was quite bright and fairly capable, he wasn't good at long-term discipline, and was court-martialled twice, and punished on a third occasion. 

His USMC service was October 24th 1956 to September 11th, 1959. He was trained as a radar operator, and served in that role in Japan. 

I don't know of any issued weapons that were automatically fatal for the users, although there were several that were quite dangerous.
