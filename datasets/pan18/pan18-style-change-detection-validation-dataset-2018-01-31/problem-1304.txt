This is true for many languages, but it's not for the Yucatec Maya, and the paper states that «plural marking in the noun phrase is not necessary for a noun to be interpreted as referring to a plurality». 

I found a paper which treats about a language (well, two, but one is mainly treated, since it's the principal object of the dissertation) being in possess of the structure "number-Classifier". The Language is the Yucatec Maya Language. 

I'll try to summarize the content through the paper, but I linked it anyway, both for a complete reference but also for attribution. If I misunderstood the paper or made some mistakes, please let me know by commenting under the answer. I don't want to leave mistakes floating in the internet. 

Then, «Plural marking and classiers have been shown to co-occur within the same phrase in Persian as well (Gebhardt, 2009) (and Karimi, pc.). Examples are shown in (9) and (10).» 

Going forward3, we see that «plural marking and classfiers co-occur even within the same phrase, in Yucatec Maya»:

It looks like your question is based on Cognitive Grammar. 

One of the best books on the passive voice is Siewierska, Anna. 1984. The passive: A comparative linguistic analysis. London: Croom Helm. 

the noisy yellow airplanes that scared the children in the yard, [that scared the children in the yard] is a complement clause. 

When you post a question next time, please mention what theory it is based on. Do not assume that the terms (and implicit assumptions) are necessarily shared and/or easily recognized by everyone. Your OP is a good case in point. 

There can be no theory-neutral evidence to refute or verify the existence of a finite VP. As a matter of fact, just in your question there are the following assumptions: the existence of a VP, finite VP, constituents etc., cf. 

Of course! The usual term is a (sentence) fragment, some started using the term "nonsententials". What language(s) are you interested in? What syntactic theory? 

You may want to start with an excellent review by Leonid Kulikov. 2011. Voice typology. In The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Typology, ed. J. J. Song. Oxford: OUP, esp. pp. 374-380. 

Nevins et al. argue that Merge is recursive because it can combine “lexical items and phrases” of any type (p. 367, n.11), cf. Zwart 2011 “[t]he operation Merge is standardly taken to be recursive in that the output of Merge may be subject to further operations Merge” (p. 116). 

At first, a couple of words on the origin of “said” in the sense of “above-mentioned”. The OED gives the following. 

As you can see from the examples above, the verb “say” in this sense is used transitively, i.e. it takes a direct object. All dictionaries of Modern English mark this dated use as legalese or used humorously. 

Putting theoretical differences aside, I am afraid you didn't quite understand your professor or textbook very well. For instance, you ask us, "Why is it that certain nouns takes modifiers and others complements?" 

Quirk et al. 1985: an adverbial clause of time, reason etc. 

"Doing" in your examples is what Huddleston and Pullum 2002 call an "gerund-participle" since they decide not to distinguish between participle I and a gerund. 

Chomsky says that Merge is putting alpha and beta together. If you want to add gamma to it, then you add gamma to a object [alpha+beta]. The issue here is that for [alpha+beta] to be different from a mere sum of alpha and beta, some new property must arise, otherwise we’ll end up with iteration. What is this new property? 

I would like to post a very important quote re: parameters and Minimalist Program from Gallego 2011 (The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Minimalism): "Minimalism is probably not the best framework to investigate parameters [...]. The early P&P thesis that variation is encoded in the syntax [...] must be abandoned [...]." I'm afraid that The atoms of language reflects old-fashioned ideas of the P&P framework, popular in the 1980s-early 90s. 

In many well-known Indo-European languages «number is inflectional and obligatory». If we have a sentence with a determiner (such as an article), a noun and a verb, they must agree by number. Taking the same examples2 from the paper: 

This is true for many languages, but it's not for the Yucatec Maya, and the paper states that «plural marking in the noun phrase is not necessary for a noun to be interpreted as referring to a plurality».
