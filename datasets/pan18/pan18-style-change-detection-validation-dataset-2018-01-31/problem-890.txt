About cardinals and ordinals Cardinals describe a notion of size. That is: how many of some type of object are there? In this respect, cardinals are a generalization of the whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, etc. They are an appropriate way to describe the size of a set. As Mozibur indicates, we do this by matching up elements of the set we wish to measure, with another set. (This is exactly what we do when we count: when you recite "one", "two", "three", "four", and so forth, you are giving each of the items you count a temporary name, matching an item with the name of a number to find out what cardinal describes the size of the set. For infinite sets, we also apply this idea of matching the elements of a set with those of a cardinal number.) Some object x is not-P — Not all objects x are P; or ∃x: ¬P(x)   ≡   ¬∀x: P(x). In the case that P is true, the constraint P ⊃ Q is put to the test, and that constraint is satisfied only if Q is true. If P and Q are both true, then the constraint is satisfied, and so P ⊃ Q is true. However, if P is true and Q is false, then it cannot be that P only if Q; the constraint is violated, so that P ⊃ Q is false. We can see from the above that both P ⊃ Q and Q ⊃ P are true, if P and Q are either both true or both false — if P and Q are themselves equivalent. This is just the observation that P ≡ Q ("P is equivalent to Q") is logically equivalent to (P ⊃ Q) & (Q ⊃ P). But precisely because P ⊃ Q and Q ⊃ P are not logically equivalent, P ≡ Q is a stronger logical statement — a tougher constraint to satisfy — than either conditional alone.
