The history of the Ancient Greek word κάστωρ (beaver) is unclear. It may be : (2) In her Aeolian dialect, did her name end with -α or with -ω ? I read in the same edition as above(*) (my translation) : 

either (ϝ)εκών, (ϝ)εκόντος as in ἑκάεργος (who acts of his own free will) or as in ἑκηβόλος (who shoots of his own free will). It's Dominique Thillaud's preferred hypothesis. 

If the Liddell-Scott-Jones recalls the later interpretation of the word (ἑκη- < ἑκάς=far), this dictionary doesn't explain the original form, hence my questions : Do other scholars agree with this analyse ? Are there other Aelion words ending in -ā where Attic has -ē or -ō ? 

The Ancient Greek word τρόπος meant originally "turn", hence various meanings like "way (to be), manner, style"... and even "way to sing/compose" like in Plato's Republic 424c μουσικῆς τρόποι "~ musical modes". The Latins created the (post classical) verb * tropare "~ invent, compose an air", lately "~ compose a poem" and finally "~ compose, invent". The word is attested in French from the tenth century (in the Saint-Léger poem, v. 100) with the meaning "~ invent, meet by chance", hence the modern meanings. 

(a) What's the etymology of "ἑκη-" ? 

Do other scholars agree with this analyse ? What's the so-called 'Egean' writing system ? (see my addendum, infra) ADDENDUM : thanks to Midas and to TKR, I may add a note. As Edwin L. Brown writes, "[...] the metrics of the Sapphic pentapody in which Alcaeus invokes Sappho by name tells absolutely against a psi-sound as the original initial in "Sappho.". As Brown points out (same remark here, page 7), since "Ἰόπλοκ' ἁγνὰ μελλιχόμειδε Σαπφοῖ" (a famous verse composed by Alcaeus) belongs to an Alcaic stanza (× ¯ ˘ ¯ × ¯ ˘ ˘ ¯ ˘ ¯ ), the metric shows that -δε Σα(πφοῖ) is to be read ˘ ¯, the last syllable being not taken in account. 

Night, fight, and wight are all pronounced with a final /-aɪt/ in Modern English. Their < -ght > spelling reflects the Middle English pronunciations, which had a final /-ixt/. (The digraph < gh > in MidEng represented the sounds /x/ or /ç/, which were also variously spelled < h >, < ch >, < ȝ >.) 

It appears to be a word in a Siouan language, though Chattaroy, WA was not founded until the early 1880's. Gk νότος notos was the South wind of the Greeks. I have no idea what its etymology is. 

Gk Βορέας boreas "north, the North Wind" was a Greek word also of unsure etymology. It has cognates in other Balkan and Slavic languages such as Alb borë "snow", Srb бура "cold north wind". It is often said to come < PIE *gʷor- "mountain". This very likely is a reference to a North wind, cold and perhaps arising from mountains, that was prominent in these people's original homeland. 1 Note, The 1838 Bosworth is available online but the scanner cut off part of the page in question. The later Bosworths don't give the same cognate information. état (state) is the exception here and I bet it is not a direct descendant but rather an early borrowing from Latin. They definitely do go to the same common ancestor, just the first etymology you found does not go deep enough. été (summer) follows pretty much the same path from aestas/aestatem. 

So from statum, there was something like estεθ at this stage (cf. Chanson de Roland, first strophe - (Charles li reis) ad estet in Espaigne). With the loss of word final consonant, the syllable opened and followed the rule of closed vowel in open syllable, becoming /e/. Norwegian del is reconstructed to proto-germanic dailiz, but that originates from PIE *dhail-, the etymon for the Slavic děliti. It is a fairly regular evolution. Starting with the accusative ending -átum, we have the loss of final nasal. Then the accented /a/ in the open syllable transitioned slowly to open /ε/ (cf. -arium > -aire, -alem > -el but also mare > mer). Eventually the post-accentual vowel got lost (and the /t/ probably first got voiced intervocally, lenited to a fricative and then lost voicing word finally).
