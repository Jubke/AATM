True to the Faith specifies what was lost during the Apostasy: 

2 For instance, Jesus said: Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. 

Scriptures from Doctrine and Covenants:

Some similar terminology is used but the LDS apply different connotation and the Jehovah Witness leadership structure is different than the LDS one. 

“Actually, no single known historical church, denomination, or set of believers meets all the requirements for the great and abominable church: it must have formed among the Gentiles; ... No single denomination or system of beliefs fits the entire description. Rather, the role of Babylon has been played by many different agencies, ideologies, and churches in many different times. … 

Similar to Article 5, the LDS are distinct in their belief of modern revelation and to inspired leaders. 

The latest edition of the Book of Mormon can be considered the official version. When translating the Book of Mormon into another language: 

This verse (the original v10) just means that the Lord is our Savior, no one else. It's also important to look at the phrasing 'before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me', God has always existed, and since He will always exist no man can ever be exalted "before" or "after" Him. All men who are exalted to godhood will be contemporaries of Yahweh, and will never precede nor follow Yahweh's existence. They will also become part of the divine council over which he presides. 

Scriptures from the Book of Mormon 

Similarly, Joseph Fielding Smith said: 

3 Names of God in OT article- highly recommend for a much better in-depth explanation, you can start half way down where it talks specifically about Psalm 110 

Scriptures on theosis (man becoming a god): 

Lord (in lowercase) refers to a heavenly ruler but is not a substitute for the name Jehovah. 2 

This is one of the major differences. The LDS believe they have the same Priesthood power and authority that was on the earth when Jesus walked the earth. It seems that Jehovah Witness leaders just need years of study based on this answer. 

The LDS's belief is that the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit and a member of the Godhead.

Our message therefore is one of special love and concern for the eternal welfare of all men and women, regardless of religious belief, race, or nationality, knowing that we are truly brothers and sisters because we are sons and daughters of the same Eternal Father.5 

Besides Matthew 22:41-45 this Psalm is also referenced in Acts 2:32-36 and Hebrews 1:13.

A principal teaching is a respect for other religions and beliefs:

This is reinforced in part from Joseph Smith History 1:34 in reference to the Book of Mormon: 

Jehovah Witnesses also believe this. 

President Ezra Taft Benson explained this by saying: 

Seems to exclude any other city but in Zephaniah 2:15 on the city of Ninevah, it has the same phrase.

First, we see that it was made in response to an attempt by the Sadducees to trap the Lord. Consequently, it would not have been the Lord’s final word on the subject. Why should the Lord scatter pearls before them that they would only trample underfoot? Second, the Lord did not say there would be no people in the married state in the resurrection, but that there would be no marriages made in the resurrection. Third, we must be clear about the “they” who are neither marrying nor being given in marriage. The context of the scriptures just cited suggests a generic rather than a specific meaning. Simply put, that means no marriages are made in the resurrection. The Lord was warning the Sadducees. They were Jews of the day who had rejected him and therefore had no access to the higher ordinances of the Melchizedek Priesthood. How could these men, whom Jesus had called a “generation of vipers” (Matt. 3:7), qualify for the highest blessings of the celestial kingdom? The Lord has previously, and we believe has again in this day, given the power to bind on earth and in heaven (Matt. 16:19, Doc&Cov 132:19) Joseph Smith has said:
