But then, you might ask, what about situations where there is an inevitable conflict of interest between different interests in one society? In particular, what about situations where the interests of a small group are inherently in conflict of those of the majority. How does one take into account such situations, yet still allow for a universal ethics of voting? Alvin Plantinga provided a solution (or what he called a defense) to the problem of evil based on the value of freewill. Assuming one believes in God, the problem is how to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the fact that God is omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent on one hand, and the existence of evil in the world on the other hand. Plantinga's defense (called a defense because he purports to show that there is no problem, as opposed to trying to solve the problem) is the following: One would assume that no matter how neutral an investigator tried to be, her theoretical presuppositions are informed by her values and the ethical system she operates within. It would become impossible not just to draw the boundary between science and metaphysics, but between science and axiology (the study of values and ethics) as well. The is/ought problem is turned on its head because no matter how hard one tries, they are always influenced by their "oughts". That these propositions are objectively true (independently of any subject) would make them true facts about the world, but they would be independent of any physical facts as well. Wouldn't this amount to a form of dualism or platonism? Is this what Kant meant by "metaphysics of morals"? Not all of my answers are sourced, some are based on my general reading of ethics courses, they are still accurate. "Can you say that in planet earth philosophy only exists because human exists?": Yes - the problems of modern philosophy, epistemology, ethics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, political philosophy, etc..., are human specific.
