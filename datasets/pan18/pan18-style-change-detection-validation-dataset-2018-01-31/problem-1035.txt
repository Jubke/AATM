"just as a living thing and a drawing of one have one name in common . . ." 

I'd say that what Aristotle means by λόγος τῆς οὐσίας has pretty well got to be what a contemporary philosopher would call a real definition. On Aristotle's view, we get definitions by empirical inquiry--gathering things together into genera and species in terms of their likenesses and differences, and then a definition (horismos or logos) which expresses the essence of the thing is just a summary of these genera and the specific differences, e.g. ``Man is a rational animal.'' 

"Things are said to by `homonyms' which have one name in common, . . ." " because the account of being corresponding to the name differs, . . ." the rest of the clause gets confusing after that though. But note two things. First there isn't necessarily a direct line between genes and beliefs. Our beliefs are formed by experience and influenced by culture, so whatever evolutionary pressures there are on our beliefs are going to be indirect. The answer is "Not at all." The problem of other minds is a metaphysical and epistemological question: "How do I know that there are other minds?" I can directly observe behavior of other humans, but to infer mentality from behavior in the case of others is to make an inference, and therefore the question arises whether the inference is a good one. (1) is just a definition that expresses the meaning of the phrase "condition of the possibility". Ὁμώνυμα λέγεται ὧν ὄνομα μόνον κοινόν, 

The importance of Aristotle's point here will only really become apparent in the Analytics, when he is describing the kind of logical unity required for scientific inquiry. There he lays down the condition that you can't transfer scientifically proven conclusions about the nature of humans to pictures of humans. This is Aristotle's way of pointing out the fallacy of equivocation.
