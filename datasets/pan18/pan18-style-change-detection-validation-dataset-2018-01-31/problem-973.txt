Finally, someone had already pointed out in this forum - I forget which post - that although we now consider Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, The Stoics and the Epicureans, and their ilk, as semi-divine mythical sources of wisdom, those guys were really just the self-help authors of their times, simply offering people advice on how to improve their lot in life. Any student of philosophy in our time is free to take their wisdom as such as well. It seems, that simplistically, that GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems can be applied to ethics in a very straightforward way by: 

I think that pragmatically speaking, in your case, ultimately the Kantian approach "wins". For placebos to work, there has to be some form of deception. Maintaining that deception indefinitely is impossible, and deception in general and in the medical profession in particular is very dangerous. The negative consequences of allowing pharma companies to sell placebos in general far outweigh the benefits of this one placebo effect (See I even managed to reconcile the Kantian view and the utilitarian view). This could also be applied to the GOP in general (not just Trump): Why should a democrat prevent a GOP administration at all cost? because they think people are more important than corporations, that the environment takes precedent over big oil, because they are pro-choice, pro-women's rights, because they think religion and state shouldn't mix, etc.... 

But it seems to me that this would immediately lead to the justification of such scenarios as: (a) Excluding the rare cases of atheists who are also dualists, most atheists are materialists who don't believe in souls. More of an extended comment, than a properly sourced answer: On the other hand, straightforward deontological ethical rules would be relatively simple to implement, since the rules are categorical and would not be context dependent the way utilitarian rules are.
