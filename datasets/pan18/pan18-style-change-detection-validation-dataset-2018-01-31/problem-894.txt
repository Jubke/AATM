That a cardinal number is itself a class that contains, as elements, all of the classes that are equinumerous with each other. (You can think of this as the equivalence class of the relation of equinumerousity.) This is more general, of course, but I think it fits quite well. Lewis seems to be arguing against materialism and astronomy. Let's call this combination science for short. This is a well defined self-referring sentence. As noted above, it can also be proven. So if self-reference is okay, then what's the deal with this: Another great source discussing these issues is this very good SEP entry on self-reference. But, all of your assumptions are questionable. Some seem to me plain false (A1, A3), and for some I have no idea what they mean (A4, A5. But it might be just me). So there's no case in which "All S is P" and "Some S is not P" are both false. The short answer is that you can still recognize a correct answer, even if you don't know what you're looking for beforehand. (Simple example: you don't know what the prime factors of a given number are. You try some combinations and eventually you recognize the correct answer simply by multiplication.) One of Frege's reasons for this distinction is that asserting an identity such as '1 + 1 = 2' is informative, while '2 = 2' is not. Some less trivial examples are: '47 + 119 = 166', 'Barack Obama = The 44th US president'. A good way to get some intuition as to whether an argument is valid or not is to translate it back to natural language and see if it makes any sense. However, you're talking about long and convoluted arguments, so this method will probably not work in such cases. And as already said, even if you feed such arguments to a computer you cannot hope for it to get you a result in finite time. That's just what predicate logic is like, no way around it.
