How can a person analyse their own speech for presence of the "dark l" sound? But I think tone sandhi is going to change it again so I'll provide an update when I have one... (h)   at the end of a word, in brackets, a breathier, slightly prolonged version of the preceding vowel sound Also I've largely lost my accent because of years of overseas travel and working with overseas travellers when I'm at home - so if I used to have it I'm still unsure whether I have it now. Then again Unicode provides COMBINING VERTICAL LINE BELOW for this purpose: But what options do we have when we want to do narrow transcriptions to illustrate the actual sounds in detail? From Lonely Planet Malay Phrasebook, 2nd Edition: I can't tell if I have it in my own idiolect or not. I believe my variety of English, General Australian, has "dark l", but I'm not sure. Czech speakers always seem to tell me that it's unique and that foreigners can never pronounce it. I actually can pronounce it though I have trouble with lots of other language sounds so for me it doesn't feel so exotic or difficult. The English Wiktionary doesn't yet provide IPA for this term but I'm requesting it. In the meantime, by piecing together pieces of other entries there I'd say the current editors working on Chinese would render it into IPA this way: What methods are used to self-analyse vowels? I'm interested both in traditional methods and technological ones, especially if I only need a PC and free software. Since vowels are more or less relative rather than having a set of features as with consonants, there seems to be more room for making incorrect assumptions about where one's own phones are located in regards to height and backness. (Obviously rounding is a bit easier.)
