Corporations are currently prohibited from making campaign contributions. 

The FCPA was repealed when the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act was passed. It was amended several times. It established the Federal Election Commission and increased disclosure of contributions for federal campaigns. It was amended in 1974 to place legal limits on the campaign contributions. 

How the system got to be this way and why. What were the driving forces? 

Multiple laws allow for the negation or commutation of penalties. The courts may reduce a sentence, a Governor or President may pardon someone. 

The Act didn't have any teeth, because it lacked penalties and an enforcement method. Congress would later pass the Federal Corrupt Practices Act 

The relevant constitution text: 

Section 393 of the Transportation Code is the law that governs signs on public ways. 

Ever since Marbury v Madison, the Supreme Court of the United States has had the power to determine what is and what isn't constitutional, and to strike down (or roll-back) an unconstitutional law. 

So the king could take hold of a case and dispense any punishment he saw fit without having to provide any justification. That included declaring someone innocent, increasing the punishment or summarily imprisoning or exiling someone (thus stopping potentially embarrassing cases immediately). In fact, the practice of imprisonment itself was created ex nihilo by the king as laws and customs only envisioned death and exile as punishments (usually however, the case would run its course and the family would then petition the king's officers to have the punishment reduced to a prison sentence). 

On the other hand, religious symbols or figures are not protected as such by French law. You won't find any law defining blasphemy in general law (but see below) or punishing offenses against Christ or Christianity. But there is a fine line between insulting a religion and insulting a group of people because of their religion. 

At the same time, the law is definitely not about public safety, being able to identify people or some other ostensibly “neutral” consideration. Besides the opinion of the ECHR, another evidence for this is that it was prepared by the commission dealing with gender equality issues and preceded by an inquiry explicitly about the hijab. And of course, there is no law that makes it mandatory to be identifiable at all times or some such. The only context in which this issue comes up is the hijab.

Elected Officials may not accept campaign contributions from corporations. 

Ever since Marbury v Madison, the Supreme Court of the United States has had the power to determine what is and what isn't constitutional, and to strike down (or roll-back) an unconstitutional law. 

It all began in 1907 with theTillman Act, Teddy Roosevelt stated in his annual address before Congress: 

As for how this is different than bribery, it would require that the campaign contribution was given to the government official with the promise to influence an official act; aid in committing fraud; or for them to omit doing their lawful duty. 

Contributions made from the treasuries of corporations, labor organizations and national banks are prohibited. Additionally, national banks and federally chartered corporations may not make contributions in connection with any election, including state and local elections. Contributions may, however, be made from separate segregated funds (also called political action committees or PACs) established by corporations, labor organizations, national banks, and incorporated membership organizations. 11 CFR 114.2 and 114.5. 

Under Louis XIV, the king also codified various types of lettres de justice. The lettre d'abolition was something we might recognise as a modern pardon, simply cancelling a punishment. But the king could also grant a lettre de réhabilitation (which would restore the “honour” of the person) or a lettre de rémission (which would pardon someone for their actions and stop criminal proceedings immediately, even before they have been found guilty). 

Finally, there is also a law against “offenses [outrage] against the national hymn or the tricolor flag”, which has been compared to a kind of “secular blasphemy” by critics. Unlike many such laws in other countries, this one was enacted very recently (2003) following some controversies about the attitude of crowds when the national hymn was played at the beginning of football matches. It's not part of the aforementioned “law on the freedom of the press” and only applies to some public events (i.e. it does not prevent you from making fun of the flag or hymn in a cartoon or a song).
