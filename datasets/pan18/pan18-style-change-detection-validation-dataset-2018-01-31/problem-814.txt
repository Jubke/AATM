This study says that for smaller doses of caffeine (from about 30 to 300mg), the infant will ingest between .06% and 1.5% of the maternal dose. In most cases, drinking less than 300mg of caffeine a day will not affect your baby. Even if your child is extra sensitive to caffeine, the effects aren't serious, and they will go away if you eliminate caffeine from your diet. My husband and I are pretty hands-off during her bedtime. We put her to bed, say goodnight, and leave. She usually fusses for about 5 minutes, but goes to sleep. But now she pulls herself up on the crib walls and cries because she gets stuck there. Unless I help her down, she'll mostly only get down by falling over. I'm afraid that she could hurt herself, and it's taking her much longer to get to sleep. That said, I suggest that you definitely set up some play dates. They'll be fun for you, and your baby can play with a new "toy" ;). The article does note that babies can easily injure other babies because they don't know not to pull hair or grab faces, so you may have to watch carefully. If you notice your baby become irritable, or agitated, or if he is having sleeping problems, you can cut caffeine out of your diet for a few days to see if that solves the problem. If you do have to stop drinking coffee, you should be able to re-introduce it after a couple of months. This study had 11 breastfeeding mothers drink 500mg of caffeine a day for 5 days. They monitored the heart rate and sleep patterns of the infants, and found no measurable effect from that dose of caffeine. I agree with Saiboogu's answer to the first part. It's hard, I know. Try and get naps during the day while he sleeps, and enlist any help you need from your partner. This phase of his life won't last long.
