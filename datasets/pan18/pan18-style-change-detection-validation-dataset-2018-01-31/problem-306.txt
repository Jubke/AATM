The flop comes and it contains a rocket. 

OK, so you've been dealt QQ and you're feeling pretty good about things and throw out a few BBs. Everyone folds but the villain. 

While you are free to leave a table whenever you wish to avoid the BB, there seem to be rules in place that govern when you're first dealt in. What are these rules - and do they vary from site to site? 

This question relates to pre-flop play and is aside from the obvious point of being more aggressive the later your position. 

I understand that this is to stop you getting an immediate positional advantage over the others, but why have the rule at one end and not the other? 

Obviously, I should ditch my ladies if a large raise comes in or villain comes over the top but there doesn't seem to be any tells I can use for mid-sized calls/raises. 

On a few occasions though, some short stacks cold call and then come over the top on the river and then villain wins with something like 22 hitting a 2 on the river. Due to the small bet, I can't really get a read, but such a hand is costly. Any idea how I should otherwise play it? I've seen many heroes in similar positions simply check on the river but this would have no effect here since villain would still throw in their last coin. 

The end result is invariably the same - a pair/set/trip rockets and I'm out of pocket. 

This is a 6 handed ring game with no ante and various positions for hero & villain. This is also the fast online variant (rush/snap/zoom etc) so hard to get a read on players without a pretty good memory! 

Let's say we're 6 handed and UTG raises to 2BB and I (sat next to villain) have something just outside the tight range - say TKs. 

I've had a few hands where I have say, KQ and the flop contains K rag Q. Clearly I am favourite here so tend to ram and jam on the flop, turn and river. 

Now there is something to be said for raising and something for seeing the flop as cheaply as possible, but why the two different views? Are these just styles or should something else drive whether I choose one or the other? N.B. I tend to play the fast online variants so there are no player reads to be had. Such examples are Rush (Full Tilt), Fast Forward (Party Poker) and Zoom (PokerStars). 

Whatever happens next, I always seem to get burned: 

This is pretty quick to calculate in my head. 

If it goes to showdown, I'd show the missing players cards, and if they win, it's their money. Keep it aside for when they come back. 

I'm not sure if is in any official rules, but I think one should be as nice as possible to players suddenly leaving the table. With that much money in the pot, it's quite possible that they've left for a medical emergency. 

With 1100 in the pot pre-flop, and a stack of 7775, you're probably in push fold territory. Push here and steal the blinds. If there was no ante, a raise to 1400 to steal 600 still gives you room to fold to a 3-bet whilst being strong enough to make the BB think seriously about calling. If they do call, you're in push/fold on the flop. Raising to only 1000 pre-flop I think makes the button assume the BB will call, so entices the button to call with drawing hands. 

I think AT is the worse hand you call with in this situation. I'd throw away KT (unless I had a flush draw), but AT is decent. It's just too easy here for villain to push if you're folding 2nd top pair with top kicker. I'd call unless villain generally doesn't bluff. 

The end result is invariably the same - a pair/set/trip rockets and I'm out of pocket.

I can understand what antes bring to a tourney, but why would you have them in regular cash games?

It would seem daft to constantly fold when A/K arrives on the board without any clear evidence villain has a pair/set/trips.
