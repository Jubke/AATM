There are several type of race in Biathlon: Different from what are you asking is the break ask by the tennis player because of a little injury (eg blisters) or to go to the toilet draw for the first 3 "matches" (first round) for 4 team per match; rankings after first round (in every single mathc you can find the first but I do not know if is it posssible to determine a second/third/fourth classified); second round determined by rankings (1vs2vs3vs4, 5vs6vs7vs8, 9vs10vs11vs12) rankings after second round; third round determined by updated rankings (1vs2vs3vs4, 5vs6vs7vs8, 9vs10vs11vs12) You can go on with many round as you need then make the last final round for the first 4 teams: 1vs2vs3vs4 

What: if you are talking about "Super Tie-break" the appendix V of ITF rules of tennis you can see info about Match tie-breaks (10 points): this is a tie-break to 10 points, a shorter solutions played instead of third (final) set • must remain on his goal line, facing the kicker, between the goalposts until the ball has been kicked.

In Giro d'Italia and other stage races such as the Tour de France and Vuelta a España, there is a maximum time to arrive at the end of the stage after which racers are disqualified.
