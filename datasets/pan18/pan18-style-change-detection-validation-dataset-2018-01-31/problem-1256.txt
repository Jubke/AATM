As such I would conclude that using the sleep visions metaphorically for desires remains highly productive and not necessary inherited from any proto-languages. This hints the root had something before the r-. Some link it to Greek root ἔρως "love" which in turn also has obscure etymology. In old Russian the word фрязь ([fr'az'], apostrophe means a soft consonant) was used to denote a westerner. Although the word is not used any more, it is kept as part of some place names, such as a town Фрязино. In this light you should consider the fact that they reconstruct two very close roots for PIE: lupos "fox" and u̯lq̆os "wolf". If we consider the p a result of alternation, we come to luq̆os vs u̯lq̆os which could be result of elementary metathesis. Cornish pemp and Latin quinque (five) According to Mallory we have the following PIE words (in this notation, g = palatal/plain ġ=plain/uvular): No, they are not borrowed, they are cognates. The Proto-Indo-European word was dusmenēs which meant "hostile" (from dus- "bad" and men- "think"). See Mallory & Adams. Note by the way, that PIE prohibited roots starting with r- altogether, a rule about which Vasmer (and Pokorny) could not know. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=enyalius-bio-1 For example, the -tion suffix comes from Latin, where it is inherited directly from PIE -ti̯om. It is a common combination of suffixes plus nominative ending of neuter/inanimate gender. Some examples of the reconstructed PIE words with that suffix: I wonder whether the word for "one" I wonder if it is connected to the Thai farang which is also used to denote a westerner. So here is the account by Eustathius (although it seems he in turn refers to Arianos): Gk Βορέας boreas "north, the North Wind" was a Greek word also of unsure etymology. It has cognates in other Balkan and Slavic languages such as Alb borë "snow", Srb бура "cold north wind". It is often said to come < PIE *gʷor- "mountain". This very likely is a reference to a North wind, cold and perhaps arising from mountains, that was prominent in these people's original homeland. 1 Note, The 1838 Bosworth is available online but the scanner cut off part of the page in question. The later Bosworths don't give the same cognate information. Pokorny does not list a Slavic reflex, but Derksen 2008 gives žiēmą ‘winter’ < *ǵheim It appears to be a word in a Siouan language, though Chattaroy, WA was not founded until the early 1880's. Gk νότος notos was the South wind of the Greeks. I have no idea what its etymology is. L vesper "evening" was also used to mean "west" in reference to the setting sun. Bosworth's 18381 Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language gives "buttor-fleoge, Plat. (Plat-dutch) Better-flege, Dut. Kil. (Dutch, from Kilian) Butor-vilege". Night, fight, and wight are all pronounced with a final /-aɪt/ in Modern English. Their < -ght > spelling reflects the Middle English pronunciations, which had a final /-ixt/. (The digraph < gh > in MidEng represented the sounds /x/ or /ç/, which were also variously spelled < h >, < ch >, < ȝ >.) Are these last two related to the prothetic s- seen in Latin sub, super? (Wiktionary gives super < *eks-uper, but ὑπέρ < *uperi, which would seem to suggest that it is just a coincidence). Here is a downloadable PDF I found of the notes that go with the presentation: Germanic ga revisited. I read through it, and disappointingly, all it says is: Some example words (I’m taking these from Wiktionary): I was confused before researching this because later on, at least in English words of Greek origin, the an- form started to be used before roots with historical spiritus asper, but I don't know when this occurred. (This can be seen in English words like anemia, anhydrous, anhedonia etc. I've been trying to find equivalent words in Greek though.) I'll update this answer once I find more discussion in scholarly journals. Is this related to the *s that comes later in each of these roots?
