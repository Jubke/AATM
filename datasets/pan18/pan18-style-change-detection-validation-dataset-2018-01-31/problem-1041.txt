Here is a similar argument from Nietzsche's On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense: 

On whether you may be looking in the wrong domain: much of (micro)economics also centers around this question (why human agents behave the way they do). You could do worse than starting almost at the beginning by reading Adam Smith (a contemporary of David Hume) on economics. 

E.g. the following one seems to argue that Hegel would be interested in categories of things (and perhaps denote them by symbols like X) whereas Wittgenstein would doubt such generalization (and perhaps describe family resemblances using ordinary sentences and words instead). 

There must be applicable quotes from (the later) Wittgenstein. 

Ludwig von Mises' description of economic behavior in Human Action also comes to mind: if memory serves he did not use a single formula (and very few symbols such as X) in a long book whose subject area (i.e. economics) would seem to offer many opportunities for symbolic notations. I am also curious whether he was influenced by a (philosophical) school in making this choice. 

Searle: Rediscovery of the Mind: Intentionality, qualia 

In a more diffused way historical materialism ideas (influence of environment and economics on social structure and culture) show up in the schools of technological determinism, e.g. Ayers's Theory of Economic Progress (1944), and geographic determinism founded by Huntington. One example of the latter is Adams's Energy and Structure (1975), another is recently popular Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel. 

Below is a list to choose from, selection depends on one's interests. If I had to select three overall by depth/influence it would be Tractatus, From a Logical Point of View and Structure of Scientific Revolutions. With restriction to after 1970: Mental Events, Naming and Necessity and Logical Basis of Metaphysics. 

According to Priest, Routley and Norman's book Applications of Paraconsistent Logic the term "dialetheism" was coined by Graham Priest and Richard Routley in 1981. They cite Wittgenstein as inspiration who in Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics describes ‘This sentence is not true’ as a Janus-headed figure facing both truth and falsity. Di-aletheia is literally double-truth, it refers to sentences that are both true and false. There is an obvious affinity to a much older term "dialectic", literally double-speak, which goes back to pre-Socratics, especially Heraclitus ("we do and do not step into the same rivers, we are and we are not"), and was revived in more recent times by Hegel (“Something moves, not because at one moment it is here and another there, but because at one and the same moment it is here and not here, because in this ‘here’, it at once is and is not”).

Feyerabend Against Method: Critique of Scientific method 

Penrose's Road to Reality and Smolin's Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next are controversial, but are by philosophizing physicists, and delve into many current topics. 

Yes, I rather doubt that Stoljar's "physicalism has no formulations on which it is both true and deserving of the name" expresses the consensus among physicalists, even if he adds that this "does not entail that philosophical problems stated in terms of it have no reasonable formulation". See Montero's review of his book for perspective. 

On other hot topics I'll recommend long papers (freely available), rather than books: 

Speaking more broadly, some writings by literary existentialists (e.g. Sartre and Camus) may be of interest, Bertrand Russell in his late essays (from 1920s), and some Freudians, starting with Freud's own Civilization and Its Discontents. Fromm's The Art of Loving "recapitulated and complemented the theoretical principles of human nature found in Fromm's Escape from Freedom and Man for Himself...", and Jung was inspired by Eastern philosophy and religion. I suppose Stoics like Seneca, Epictet and Mark Aurelius count too, but if you are looking for edginess there is not much of that there.
