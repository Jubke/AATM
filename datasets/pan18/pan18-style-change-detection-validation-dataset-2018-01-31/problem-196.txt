Note that if your bike has a presta or dunlop valve, you'll need either an adapter or a different head. 

Like most things bicycling, there's little standardization of these. The most useful reference is here at Park Tool's site. 

It's called an axle nut in bicycling parlance. In general terms, it's a type of flange nut. 

These days, many "hand built" wheels are really hand finished. The machine does the initial lacing and tensioning, the human does the final tension balancing. This could take less than five minutes of human time. 

Campagnolo advertises the Khamsin Asymmetric Wheel: 

It could be a 5/16 inch x 24 tpi, 3/8 inch x 24 tpi or 8mm x 1mm. Or some weird other variant. The likelihood of finding the right one at a hardware store is low and you might accidentally jam or cross-thread it if you force it. For example, some axle nuts are 26tpi which will thread part way then jam. 

I suggest you take tube as deciding factor off the table. 

There is a down side to not fixing the wheel if it is bent enough to rub the brake. 

The clearance is only 1/2 the difference so a change of about 2 cm. But 2 cm is enough to notice. Not just clearance you change geometry. But that may be a good thing for your supertanker. 

A tire with more displacement has more resistance. That resistance is more more heat. There is conservation of energy. 

On a skate board you want a wide contact patch. On a skate board you absolutely don't want the wheel to tilt. The idea is to keep the width but reduce contact area. The reduced contact patch has lower rolling resistance. Within the virtual flat contact surface are circular surfaces that will shed debris (small rocks). They can also can go with softer material so you give back on rolling resistance but get softer ride and more grip. They are not taking over the skate board market but they have a niche and it may grow to dominate. It is more than just a fad with no real value. And some people will buy it because it looks cool.
