We are not normally in the business of discussing user history. In this case, only part of the story was told, so I feel that full disclosure is warranted. First Closure I closed your question the first time for the following reason: Do NOTHING. The daily vote anomaly script will pick it up and your rep will be recalculated automatically. If after 36 hours (give the script time to run) you still see a problem, then flag one of your posts and ask a moderator to look into the anomalous voting patterns. If it still hasn't been corrected, contact the SE team via the "contact us" link at the bottom of any page on the site. (Adding reasons as they come in...) Right now if I put a three month contract in, it makes it seem like I was employed there for an entire year, instead of 3 months. Discussion What other statistics would you like to see for Careers? What metrics would be helpful to you in measuring the effectiveness of your CV? We looked closely at performance over the last few weeks, particularly in the last 4 or 5 business days. 1.47, 1.33 Average answer score we were getting sloppy about the way we handled search engines, which was causing a lot of undue load -- Google's crawler is now indexing us at, and I am not making this up, 10 requests per second which is the maximum. This is confirmed in Google Webmaster Tools. Google doesn't need all the same work done per page that, say, a user does -- and when Google hits thousands of pages in a few minutes, that can kick off a lot of background work, such as rebuilding related questions. Not expensive by itself, but when multiplied by a hundred at once.. can be quite painful. we are restructuring and reorganizing our JavaScript to make the delineation between "only anonymous users need this" and "registered users need this" clear, so as to reduce the footprint of our site to an absolute minimum for anonymous users. This also significantly improves page load time (perceived and actual) for registered users as well.
