For the bots I can report number of bluffs but I don't really know if the hero was bluffing. 

You could have just bet out 7 for the same effect. Your bluffs are now more expensive on every street. Then follow up on the turn with like 12. 

Why in the world did you check raise? You are on a draw. You don't need to build pot equity with this guy. He has led out every round. Even if he did just call then it would likely slow him down on the river. 

What does it take to price someone out of a flush draw on the turn? 4 on the board and 2 in the opponents hand. 52 - 4 - 2 = 46 cards out 9 cards left to make a flush So the odd to make the flush is 9 : 37 = 1 : 4.11 What is interesting here is you know there are no flush in your hand so the actual odds are 9 : 35 = 1 : 3.89 What bet gives your opponent exactly 0 reason to call -bet + 9/37(bet + pot) = 0 9/37 pot = (1 - 9 /37) bet 9/37 pot = 28/37 bet bet / pot = 9 / 28 = 32% You have to bet right at 1/3 of the pot for call to be a wash Your opponent should call anything up to 1/3 pot bet by you Your bet is in the pot (4/3) / (1/3) = 4 : 1 At that point you are getting pot odds of 8 : 2.5 You odds of winning the hand is only 86 : 13 You were getting 1/2 the odds you needed and you were going to face more bets 

This is a 6 handed ring game with no ante and various positions for hero & villain. This is also the fast online variant (rush/snap/zoom etc) so hard to get a read on players without a pretty good memory! 

Whatever happens next, I always seem to get burned: The end result is invariably the same - a pair/set/trip rockets and I'm out of pocket. 

I can understand what antes bring to a tourney, but why would you have them in regular cash games? On a few occasions though, some short stacks cold call and then come over the top on the river and then villain wins with something like 22 hitting a 2 on the river. Due to the small bet, I can't really get a read, but such a hand is costly. Any idea how I should otherwise play it? I've seen many heroes in similar positions simply check on the river but this would have no effect here since villain would still throw in their last coin. OK, so you've been dealt QQ and you're feeling pretty good about things and throw out a few BBs. Everyone folds but the villain. 

Let's say we're 6 handed and UTG raises to 2BB and I (sat next to villain) have something just outside the tight range - say TKs. 

Now there is something to be said for raising and something for seeing the flop as cheaply as possible, but why the two different views? Are these just styles or should something else drive whether I choose one or the other? N.B. I tend to play the fast online variants so there are no player reads to be had. Such examples are Rush (Full Tilt), Fast Forward (Party Poker) and Zoom (PokerStars).
