On a faster machine with 8 core could process 8 hands in parallel so would get 100,000 down to the 10 second range. 

Your chance of a suited hole cards is 12 / 51 = 0.235 Just short of 1/4 

I a mid range PC I get about 10,000 shuffles in 20 seconds. A 100,000 takes about 3 minutes. I am writing a poker calculator and odds were jumping around so I thought there was an error so I traced it down. The pattern pretty much indicates to me the calculator is correct. All the 0 below the x is bock / steal on the straight below. Ace high has more straights as there is no block above. 

Based on hand independent it is 0.000256 (quad) * 0.0017 (boat) = 0.00000044 player class properties wins, ties, losses from those three every thing else is calculated 

What are the odds of flopping a flush or 4 flush? combin(52,4) = 27,0725 possible starting hole cards combin(5,2) = 10 ways to get 2 of the nut flush combin(4,1) = 4 suite combin(47,2) = 1081 other card combination that do not block your royal 

When it need less cards to fill in the steal the steal is more common Opponent chance = 5*39/50 = 0.16 That is random 

flush hit on turn or river or both ( 9 flush x 47 other card + combine(9, 2) ) / combin(47, 2) = 0.3496762257 = 35% = 1 / 2.9 

Quick If you have a good hand just count the number of hands that beat you. If you have the low end of straight then 16 hands can beat you. Can you put your opponent on 16 hands that don't beat you. 

From the boat there are 45 cards out and need to match the pair on the board So the odds of getting quadded are: (2/2) / (45/2) = 0.00101 = 0.1% Which also = 2/45 * 1/44 

You could technically have two royal draws in your 4 cards

I am surprised 78 is better than 9T 

If your opponent is only playing A-T then 0.40 chance they have single flush (higher than you). Well pair are also in their range - but then they can make a boat to beat your flush so that is about a wash. Overall it is about twice as hard to make a flush compared to a straight. probability At 10 million a Monte Carlo method is going to be very accurate. 

With the brute force approach running all board is not practical. With two hands there are 48*47*46*45*44 boards = 205,476,480. Even on at 100,000 in 10 seconds that is like 6 hours. 

Immediate odds to call a single bet/raise is not the same as overall pot odds. 

what if they bet 100x pot pot odds (1 + 100)/100 = 101/100 EV = 0 = b*101 - (1-b)*100 0 = 201b - 100 b = 100 / 101 ~ 1/2 The math does not change that much from 5x pot bet to a 100x It is about intimidation 

How often do you need to get fold to make the bluff profitable? If any quad and full house from paired hole cards then just multiply by 13 * 12 I just ran the numbers and thought it was worth posting 

Continue after the turn if you don't hit is another thing! One big factor is if you hit on turn you have you have two more rounds to get paid off. If they fire off 1/2 the pot again that is 1/2 of a much bigger pot and now you would need to get paid off on 1/2 of much much bigger pot on the river if you hit - not likely. And you need consider they are likely on 2 pair or trips to fire twice like that so now two of your outs are gone to a boat. Your outs are 7 of 46 = 4.6:1. At this point you hope they check to you as about all you can call is a 1/4 pot bet. I see a 1/2 pot call on the flop as trap you only use in the right situation that either gets sprung on the turn or not. If it works you don't want to just get paid off - you want it to sting. Let them think you cannot be chased off a draw with 1/2 pot bet. They will not let you use a poker calculator at a live table.

First to act Are ahead is not really the issue. Are there hands they could call with that you beat. So you need a pretty dominant hand like a straight that could get called by a trips or two pair. If the board is paired for sure you are getting called by a boat.
