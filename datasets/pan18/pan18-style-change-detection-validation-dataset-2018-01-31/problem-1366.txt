Other scriptures of the Israelites being encouraged to stop worshiping other divine beings or idols, but Yahweh alone (it's a recurring theme/problem): 3 https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-45-the-millennium?lang=eng Some leaders mentioned in Preach My Gospel (the LDS missionary teaching manual) are: John Wycliffe, Martin Luther, William Tyndale, John Calvin, Buddha, Confucius, and Mohammed.3 Abinadi on the Father and Son mentions the Acts2:36 reference to the Psalm 6 The lexicon defines every word in the English scriptures so translators can better understand the meaning of the words. Often, words have more than one meaning, so translators must depend on context, inspiration, and teamwork to identify the right solution. Occasionally, questions about meaning are resolved only by the First Presidency. While the LDS believe they are the true restored church they believe other religions and religious leaders have bits of the truth and were often important in the work of the restoration. Biblical basis of sealing/binding power is seen in Matt 16:19 where Jesus Christ gives Simon the power to bind on earth and in heaven. The LDS believe that that authority was lost during the apostasy and has been restored through the prophet Joseph Smith. (see also Eccl 3:14, Mark 10:9, Matt 28:18) 1 https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/what-is-the-holy-spirit/ Both believe in gifts of the spirit but the Jehovah Witnesses believe that the gifts of the spirit stopped with the Apostles.4 Another distinctive difference is the LDS belief in more scripture: the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. The Jehovah Witnesses believe the Bible to be the word of God.2 Also at first glance may seem similar but it is my understanding that Jehovah Witnesses believe only 144,000 will be resurrected to rule with Jesus in heaven while others will be resurrected and be given a chance to learn God's ways or be destroyed forever.2 -> pt 6 and 9 The LDS believe all will be resurrected and everyone has a chance to be with Jesus in heaven, but those who choose not to follow God's ways will find place in another kingdom of glory.3 3 Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory. The LDS believe that LORD (uppercase) is used in place of printing Jehovah, who we believe to be Jesus Christ, during the translation process. 1,2 3 https://www.lds.org/topics/resurrection?lang=eng The third passage in Jude 1:6,7 mentions angels who kept not their first estate. From the Encyclopedia of Mormonism it says: Because this isn't Mormon terminology it is hard to get a specific answer but based on the previous answer (above) there are spiritual and physical reasons that would warrant the label "Great Tribulation". The second passage in 2 Peter 2:4,5 refers to spirits as angels (which Mormons believe to be synonymous, but we know from the first passage what type of angels (spirits)) and how they are in hell or spirit prison awaiting judgment. No. We have to measure when the first sign of the Jesus' Second Coming is to the Second coming (no specific time period), plus 1,000 year Millenium, and then Final Judgement (again no specific time period). So at least 1,000 years. 1 Nephi 13:1-9 mentions a great and abominable church and LDS manuals explain this with the following commentary: 9 https://wol.jw.org/ase/wol/d/r266/lp-asl/1997003 and https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/w20150615/remain-chaste/ Mostly aligned except Jehovah Witnesses belief of the Holy Ghost is: Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1915–85) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles defined the great and abominable church: “The titles church of the devil and great and abominable church are used to identify all … organizations of whatever name or nature—whether political, philosophical, educational, economic, social, fraternal, civic, or religious—which are designed to take men on a course that leads away from God and his laws and thus from salvation in the kingdom of God” (Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed. [1966], 137–38). 8 https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/tolerant-of-other-religions/ 1 https://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-1-the-message-of-the-restoration-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng First, it's important to take that scripture in context so going through verse 12 reads: Consistent with these truths, we believe that God has given and will give to all peoples sufficient knowledge to help them on their way to eternal salvation, either in this life or in the life to come . . .
