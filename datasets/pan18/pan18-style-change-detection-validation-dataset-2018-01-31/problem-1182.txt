In the time of Charlemagne, governance was exercised by a king and his military advisers. Currently governance is exercised by a state supported by economic advisers. If I remember correctly, the Estates General was called as a "Hail Mary" play - get the largest possible buy in to the emergency measures necessary to keep the country from disintegrating into anarchy. There are a few assumptions here that, in my opinion, muddy the waters. Communists offered class solidarity to a world that wasn't accustomed to thinking in terms of classes. (I yearn for those halcyon days when we could actually think about a problem before first assigning blame to the bourgeois). You would ultimately be united with people who shared your class interest, but you had to learn communism before you understood your class interest. And of course if you didn't understand your class interest, you were a counter-revolutionary and should be punished. Is there anyone who wants to admit that they don't share their class interest? Trains to the labor camps form on the left. "Is there a God" provides a graph showing that non-Abrahamic religions have maintained a substantial membership since at least 1900 - In order to fully answer the question we need to establish that there were non-Abrahamic adherents between the inquisition and 1900. There is also a cultural context. Germany and Italy needed hope, and their culture was receptive to ideologies that provided hope. I'm not as familiar with Italian Fascism, but remember that German Fascism was in part a reaction to French Liberalism. France conquered Europe and imposed "liberalism" on the conquered people. Germany knew what "liberalism" looked like, and it looked a lot like oppression. Germany explored alternatives to Napoleonic Liberalism - alternatives in which it was possible to be proud to be a German.
