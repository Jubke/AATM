If you are writing a question about how to perform a certain task and then you answer with your solution, that is alright (although there is a community backlash against that in some circles). I am generally one of those people who will post fast answers, but I will also go in and revise my question as I go along adding more and more information the longer it stays open. This does not have to be the case in every instance because sometimes the best answer is one that tells you what the answer is and then gets out of the way. If I want to know 2+2, I don't need a dissertation on the subject before being told it's 4. 

As far as the FAQ is concerned, answering your own question is okie dokie, even if you are only asking the question to begin with so that you can get your code out there. As long as it's a legit question (something that somebody else may at some point may be asking) it is fine. If you post material which can be attributed as spam (such as a link to your own product or to your own site instead of providing the necessary code on your answer) it will probably be dealt with even more harshly. We should not be trying to leverage individual users but the entire community. But if all you want to do is post "Hey I made this code, here have it!" that is sure to get closed because it wouldn't be treated like a question. 

I find this to be horrible decision (and I know I'm not the only one). We've spent a year now rewarding those who answer well and answer fast. I do not see why this is a problem. StackOverflow is a Q&A site, it is not a discussion site. Is there a problem with someone getting a very fast and correct answer? Does every answer need to be long-winded?
