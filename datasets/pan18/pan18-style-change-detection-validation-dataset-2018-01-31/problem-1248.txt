SOUTH AMERICA / Top-level families: 

EDIT: Oh, and I almost forgot about the indispensable TITUS, with lots of text samples, corpora, databases, grammatical sketches and much more! Given a contact situation whereby Language A undergoes lexical influence from Language B, after some time, most of the basic concepts in Language A still remain relatively intact, whereas the cultural lexicon has seen a significant influx of words from Language B. At this point, another player appears on the scene: Language C. The influence from Language B stops, no more loanwords can be adopted from it, and it is Language C that takes over the role of the major, perhaps only, lexical donor. /gala/, /gla/, /galaM/, /glaM/, /gaMla/, /gaMlaM/ /kala/, /kla/, /kalaM/, /klaM/, /kaMla/, /kaMlaM/, /skala/, /skla/, /skalaM/, /sklaM/, /skaMla/, /skaMlaM/ /kʰala/, /kʰla/, /kʰalaM/, /kʰlaM/, /kʰaMla/, /kʰaMlaM/, /skʰala/, /skʰla/, /skʰalaM/, /skʰlaM/, /skʰaMla/, /skʰaMlaM/ (s)K(V)(M)rV(M) 

Similarly, we can generalize the question and set the software tool to find out, whether reading a text T writing by means of writing system W1 leads to greater nubmers of possible readings than writing system W2, whether also representing the same language, or a different one completely. 

BOTH NORTH & SOUTH / Top-level families: /gara/, /gra/, /garaM/, /graM/, /gaMra/, /gaMraM/ /kara/, /kra/, /karaM/, /kraM/, /kaMra/, /kaMraM/, /skara/, /skra/, /skaraM/, /skraM/, /skaMra/, /skaMraM/ /kʰara/, /kʰra/, /kʰaraM/, /kʰraM/, /kʰaMra/, /kʰaMraM/, /skʰara/, /skʰra/, /skʰaraM/, /skʰraM/, /skʰaMra/, /skʰaMraM/ You can see now, that a simple <KA-RA> may have tens of possible interpretations. Clearly, reading Mycenaean clay tablets must have been very difficult at times, especially in case of lists of personal names. Some Follow-up Remarks: What are the most significant caveats never to be neglected? Some questions to be asked and parameters my tool should obviously take into account and probably include: 

I have been thinking of developing a software tool that would make it possible to calculate the efficiency of a particular writing system (attested rather than hypothetical) for a particular language (primarily attested, usually ancient and thus also extinct) with respect to the ambiguity of interpretation/reading, whether this ambiguity is caused by homography or any other "deficiencies". (b) Further loosening And if this doesn't turn out to be fruitful either, well, then I'll be grateful for any analogical cases from languages other than English. Being a native speaker of Czech, I will be happy to have a look at my own mother tongue, of course, but it seems the picture was skewed by the artificial revitalization efforts of the National Revival. Imagine now a three-word clause, each (graphical) word composed of two syllabograms and, in accord with the rules, delimited by the vertical stroke symbol, such as the following: 

kalaXkoloXkulu kalaXkoloXku lu kalaXkoloX kulu kalaXkolo Xkulu kalaXko loXkulu kalaX koloXkulu kala XkoloXkulu ka laXkoloXkulu kalaXkoloX ku lu kalaXkolo Xku lu kalaXko loXku lu kalaX koloXku lu kala XkoloXku lu ka laXkoloXku lu etc. up to something like ha raž ho rož hu ru (the alternative, pseudo-Slavic, system also fails to distinguish /h/, /x/ and /k/ on the one hand, and /r/, /ř/, /l/ and /ľ/ on the other, along with other missing distinctions in other consonant rows). 

"Case Study": Linear B The predominantly syllabic writing system of Linear B displays a lot of ambiguity with respect to the phonology and phonotactics of Mycenaean Greek language it was used for. Some examples include...
