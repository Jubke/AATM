Christians don't hold a personal philosophy that revolves around which way an electron spins about its axis or doesn't spin or just disappears completely. +-----------------+   (Incarnation)

 DN = divine Nature St. Thomas Aquinas - On the Trinity and the Incarnation Chapter 39 Any act of charity helps build up within you the virtue of charity, but the most difficult acts are the ones that help the most. Giving one dollar to your Church is not a difficult act, steadily increasing your giving as you have the means will make you more charitable. Giving one dollar to a homeless person is not a difficult act, buying them a coat (or giving them your own is) 

The novena was to consist of being assigned one freshly minted hydrogen atom (a New Atom, if you will) and contemplating it, mediating on its mysteries. Then they were to report their findings to the abbot. God must want us to increase in virtue, so whatever acts make us increase the most align us best on the path to seek the will of God.

But where does that idea come from in the Bible? The problem with hell is that God is there! It is where God pours out his eternal judgement on all things evil. This is a part of his nature and God's wrath will be a very present reality of hell for all eternity. While we can't paint an exact picture of hell, we do have have some fairly vivid and specific descriptions of the way God is involved in punishment: This includes hell. The problem with your question is not the doctrine of omnipresence, but the doctrine of hell. You state:
