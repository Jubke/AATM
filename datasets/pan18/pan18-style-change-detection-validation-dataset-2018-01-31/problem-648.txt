b) You will not know beforehand if the risk is worth it. If someone knew a year before that Michigan race was going to be that close and would be the one that decided the POTUS, maybe he could consider the risk of being caught modifying a few hundreds or thousands of votes justified by the possibility of changing the government. But if he does not know if those hundred or thousands are going to be decissive or just "noise", there is way less incentive to attempt fraud. The bill is simply not finished. While someone took pride that it was short (as if it were of any value to the general public), any question about undecided points was swept under the rug of the "third bucket". And, despite evidence of the contrary, most representatives are smart enough to see that if these problematic details are in the third bucket, the third bucket will simply never come to pass. It is like preparing a budget by deciding what to spend the money on but without telling how the money will get earned in the first place. Mutual Assured Destruction: As the Comey case shows, firing one of such top level officials can be very damaging to the president him/herself, unless the action is beyond all doubt2. Of course, the President being under investigation by such official makes it near impossible to claim that the President action had no hidden motives. The bill is unpopular. As stated above, people has come to see benefits in the ACA, and they do not want them taken away. Worse, the most hit by the new law seems to be mostly republican held areas, which could mean a very heavy electoral cost to any representative supporting it. Coordination must be stablished with local authorities; this is even more complex than in the USA because most of the USA soldiers will ignore the country language, laws and cultural differences.
