It is referring to Amniotic fluid, at least according to the sermons we hear in our Baptist Church. 

I think that "is there Biblical evidence" is a completely different question than "do old earth Christians believe". 

It's not even a Christian perspective that's needed. It's a historical one. 

It is the good news that is revealed to us in the Bible. The Bible is the collection of 66 books (Genesis-Revelations), written over a long period, by different authors, from different backgrounds, yet revealing one unified message, and the Gospel is the message they tell. 

The NT canon developed, or evolved, over the course of the first 250-300 years of Christian history. If the NT had been delivered by an angel, or unearthed as a complete unit it would not be as believable. Part of the historical validity of the NT comes from the fact that we can trace its development, albeit not as precisely as we might like. 

The point is, these are the treasures of the Church and they are increasing at a great rate, while worms and moths eat at the treasures many of the "1st world" Christians have stored up for themselves. 

   34 “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” 

During Religious Ed. last night the review book had a question that we didn't see explained in the text (using Faith and Life Series for 7th Grade). 

This is asked from a Catholic perspective, but I think any tradition that doesn't hold that the literary style was in fact inspired (whatever that means) could help me answer this question. 

As far as I know, the Catholic Church considers God's revealed truth in Sacred Scripture to be part of, but by no means the sum total of Divine Revelation. Sacred Scripture is the written part of our Traditions, but it is entirely possible to have a Catholic Church without Biblical literacy (or literacy at all).
