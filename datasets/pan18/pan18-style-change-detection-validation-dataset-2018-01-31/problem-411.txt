5:85 Strongest among men in enmity to the Believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the Believers wilt thou find those who say, "We are Christians": Because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant. 

The prophet not only allowed charity to be given to family members, but said that double the reward is issued once for helping a family member and one for zakat: 

in conclusion, there is no evidence that a fraternity is prohibited in islam. However i cannot speak on behalf of the freemasons due to the limited information given on their secret organization, i do not know if any haram (prohibited) activity is being carried out within the fraternity and its members.

Most Sunni schools of thought consider the whole of the dog as najis, and so (knowingly) having dog hair on your clothes would require cleaning before you pray. The Hanafi school however only considers wet contact with a dog as najis (i.e. the dog's saliva) and it's hair as not najis.
