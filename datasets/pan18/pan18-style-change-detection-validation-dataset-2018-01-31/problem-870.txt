in a similar way to how the limit ordinals ω, 2ω, and so forth are defined. (We would normally also include 1, 2, 3, ω+1, ω+2, 2ω+1, and so forth in the union; but I'm trying to just sketch the construction.) This would allow us ultimately to define ordinals such as ω2+3ω+7 by repeating the same process as before for the ordinals 2ω, 3ω, etc.. and so forth. For every ordinal α, we define α+1 := α ∪ {α}. Where cardinals express the size of a set, such as {a,b,c}, the ordinals describe the order type of a sequence, such as (a,b,c). This only becomes important when you have infinitely long sequences, however. So Barbour has perhaps succeeded in reducing the notion of time to the hard problem of consciousness, provided a hypothesis about the universe being large and random enough to give rise to enough "nows" that there is a plausible sense of continuity. Even if we grant this: does this mean that time is an illusion? Provided that Barbour could explain why we experience anything if the universe consists of a static ensemble of "nows", this would rather be a mechanism (or rather construction) for the emergence of temporal change as an experience. Regardless of what underlies it, I am unable to avoid the simple fact that I experience change; therefore it does not really seem justifiable to dismiss time as a phenomenon (or a way of describing a phenomenon). You can match up the elements of ω2 with those of ω by the formula aω+b ⇒ a+(a+b)(a+b+1)/2. In many cases, the complication to life added by technology is due to the adoption of technology for reasons other than personal utility. Almost by definition, any technology which is more useful than its alternative will simplify your life. The problem is when you adopt it for reasons other than utility, or when you start engaging in activities facilitated by the device which previously you did not engage in. We order the ordinals by saying that α < β if and only if α ∈ β. This is important when we start talking about infinite ordinals. The first infinite ordinal is what comes from considering the set of all of the finite ordinals. It describes a sequence of elements which are well-ordered, but which has no final element: (0,1,2,...). We call this ordinal ω. We then define the next largest ordinal by ω+1 := ω ∪ {ω}, as before: this describes an ordering (0,1,2,...,ω), where there are an infinite number of elements hiding in the ellipses, but where there is no "item that comes just before ω"; any consecutive collection of items which contains ω and some items which come before it must have infinitely many elements. This is just a result of the way that ω was defined. It's what is known as a limit ordinal: it comes at the end of an infinite sequence of elements which lead up to it, putting a cap on top of an infinite subsequence. We get other limit ordinals by piling infinitely many other ordinals on top of it: we have ω+2 := (ω+1) ∪ {ω+1}, and we can define ω+3, ω+4, etc. the same way until we can define
