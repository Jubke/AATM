You are encountering a theology called Dispensationalism. 

This approach also upholds the role and status that Christ gives to the Church as more than simply individual believers who happen to meet together. It is also related to the Orthodox approach, which reserves to the church the role of interpreting scriptures, but does not do it through the church hierarchy in the same way the Catholic church does. 

The Holy Spirit that Christians have now is the same Holy Spirit that was promised to the disciples. When Jesus talks about "another" advocate, he means "beside himself" (Note that the use of "another" in John 14 occurs before the use of "the advocate" in John 16, so "another" in John 14 cannot mean a second one as well as the one in John 16.) 

Books can and have been written on this subject. Different traditions have different ways of interpreting the Bible. 

In English the pronoun would typically refer to the last object (the pillar of cloud). In Hebrew it isn't as clear cut, and there isn't the distinction between "he" and "it" (at least not in this case), and it is certainly possible that the pronoun refers further back than that, to something previously mentioned, such as God. 

Third, don't underestimate the 'bad light' argument. The torches would not have been modern flashlights, but flickering flames. 

Now let's look at the circumstances. The 'officials' are enforcers of an occupying power (Babylon) which has conquered Israel, and they are trying to kill Jeremiah, whose only crime is speaking the word of the Lord. To insist that you must tell the truth to them at all times in those circumstances is the equivalent of insisting that a French Christian in the 1940s always tell the truth when the Nazis ask if there are Jews hidden in their house. Some would say that is exactly what they should do, but not everyone would. 

Jesus, in himself, is the Most High God* and worthy of our worship, praise and adoration. Nothing can change that. John is quite correct to say that he is not worthy to untie his shoes. 

When you interpret the Bible, you have to look at whole passages and not just individual verses out of context. The surrounding text will give you a reference for the meaning of a verse. In this case the verse is in the middle of a chapter where the entire focus is on the reactions of people to things that were lost and are now found - a lost sheep, a lost coin, and a lost son. This gives us a pretty clear indication that Jesus is driving home a point about how people react to things that were lost and area now found, and how this applies to Heaven. We should therefore look at this statement, and all the ones around it, to find out things about lostness and being found - not about the nature of sin and angels. It is a general principle with parables that you can come to wrong conclusions by pushing an analogy too far.
