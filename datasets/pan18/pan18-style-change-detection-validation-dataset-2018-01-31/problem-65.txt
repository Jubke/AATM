Dashing Strike dashes you to the other side of the enemy that you are on. It can also dash you out of a tight spot. Use this to avoid boss attacks. Butcher winds up his big swing? Dash behind him, and keep going. This takes split-second timing, however, as I've found some enemies will wind up, and if you dash before they begin the attack animation, they'll turn to hit you. You may have better luck dashing away from your enemies. The dodge bonus from the rune only functions when you hit something. It will not work just dashing from one point to another. Also keep in mind that damage spots tend to interrupt the dash, so don't take it as a get out of jail free card. 

Nice to have, but not essential: Attack Speed is a no-brainer. Faster attacks mean more hits, which means more life. The damage boost is a side bonus. 

Life Regeneration is the secondary concern. Life on hit heals burst damage. Life regeneration heals damage areas, keeps you up while you run over them to get to (or away from) something. Also, it's easy enough to replace the Mantra of Healing entirely with all of two or three pieces of equipment, allowing you to focus on dodging. No, there's no way to un-learn a recipe. But luck is with you! Every legendary has a level 70 equivalent. It'll be slightly renamed (ie. Umbral Oath has a level of 9, and it's level 70 variant is the Living Umbral Oath), but the sprite will be the same, and the stats it gives will be along the same lines, just modified for level 70. 

You are going to die from time to time. It happens. Don't get frustrated. Learn from it, and experiment. Vortex sucks you onto an Arcane Sentry? Hopefully Serenity is available. If not, take your lumps and try again.
