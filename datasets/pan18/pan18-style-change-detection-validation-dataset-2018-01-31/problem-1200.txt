Tensions began between the two over social and policy issues. 

And Isolationism/Non Interventionism (I don't differentiate) dominated American politics. Perhaps most Americans were sympathetic to Britain and saw Germany as the clear aggressor, But they did not see it as any of America's business. America's brand of Isolationism, did not advantage either the aggressor or victim. We saw ourselves as small fish, easily devoured when the big fish quarreled. Also, Lindberg and Joe Kennedy painted admirable images of Hitler raising the German people out of despair and poverty and making them productive again. America was against the punitive actions taken by the victors of WWI against Germany. Americans believed these actions had impoverish Germany, and Americans had empathy for the German's economic hardships. That Hitler and the Nazi's were changing this unfair impoverishment in Germany was a good thing right! This argument played on US sympathies. Isolationism was well supported by America's political leadership, reflecting the support it had with the population. Johnson was a racist segregation leader when it politically was to his advantage to be so. He would now prove to be one of the greatest and most effective desegregationists when it was politically in his interest to be so. On November 22 1963, President Kennedy is shot and killed in Dallas Texas; leaving Johnson President. With the nation mourning the fallen President who had tried and failed to pass the civil rights bill; It was in Johnson't political interest to do what many thought was impossible. Johnson would resurrect and pass the most comprehensive civil rights bill in the nations history. At the beginning of WWII his rank was lieutenant colonel. When his friend George Patton was given a command in North Africa in 1942 colonel Eisenhower asked for a position on Patton's staff which was denied by United States Army Chief of Staff George Marshal. The position George Marshal had in mind for Ike was Supreme Allied Commander Europe, an advancement over nearly 400 more senior officers. 

Using The USS Liberty attack, June 8th, 1967 as a fulcrum or pivot what historical events had the most influence on relatively cool relations prior to 1967, and exponentially improving relations after 1967? 

George Gordon, a Democrat and Congressman for Tennessee's 10th congressional district, became one of the Klan's first members. In 1867, Gordon became the Klan's first Grand Dragon for the Realm of Tennessee, and wrote its Precept, a book describing its organization, purpose, and principles. 

The logistical mismatch gave the United States the means to utterly destroy the Japanese wherever they found them. 

The Neutrality Act of 1939 allowed belligerents to purchase war materiel from the United States, but only on a “cash and carry” basis. Britain had little cash. The Johnson Act of 1934 also prohibited the extension of credit to countries that had not repaid U.S. loans made to them during World War I—which included Great Britain. The US military believed Great Britain would surrender after the surrender of France, and any weapons sent to her would ultimately end up in German hands. On this basis they opposed sending weapons to the UK. President Roosevelt had to develop an initiative that was consistent with the legal prohibition against the granting of credit, satisfactory to military leadership, and acceptable to an American public that generally resisted involving the United States in any foreign(European) conflict. 

Here is a good article which details the wide spread mutilation of Japanese soldiers, living and dead which occurred during WWII.

The repayment crisis wouldn't be resolved until President Grant would take office. In 1870 President Grant's Secretary of the Treasury Boutwell finally got a strategy through congress to retire ( refinance ) the nations Civil war Debt. Congress authorized the Secretary, to issue $500 million in 10 year bonds at 5 percent, $300 million in 15 year bonds at 4.5 percent, and $1 billion in 30 year bonds at 4 percent. These bonds were to be paid in gold and exempt from local and Federal taxation. Though it would require more than 30 years from the end of the war for the Union to pay off it's Civil War Debt, the 1870 act closed the book on the repayment and refunding crisis which followed the war. Taney isn't saying slaves have no rights, he's discussing all black men. Roosevelt was also in a position to read German and French newspapers in their native languages.
