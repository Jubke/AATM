In the English Great Vowel Shift, Middle English /iː/ diphthongized to [ɪi], then became [əɪ], and finally Modern English [aɪ]. Non-initial /h/ was lost. This led to: 

Gk ἠώς eos was used in Greek and also meant "dawn", which is cognate with Latin aurora and Germanic east. ἠώς < PIE *h₂ewsṓs/*h₂ausōs < *aus- "shine". This is conjectured to be a reference to the shining dawn; but see 'south'. 

(Note that he implies but does not explicitly include the resultative suffix ****-(é)mn̥-** which leads to the complete forms shown.) I don't know if it will be possible to determine if these were borrowings, calques, or cognates. These are all West Germanic languages spoken in a fairly small area that probably didn't have abrupt transitions between languages. (Note there there is also Pokorny Etymon *sneigu̯h- 'to snow; snow' > Eng snow L nivis 'snow' OCS снѣгѵ snĕgŭ 'snow' Gk νῐφάς niphas 'snow, flake' Pra 'siṇeha' 'snow' which is apparently unrelated, although I suppose it could be.) South L merīdiēs (adj. merīdiōnālis) meant "noon, midday" < medius “middle” + diēs “day”. Since the sun is in the South at midday in the Northern hemisphere, this word is self-explanatory. North L septentriō (adj. septentriōnalis) = septem "seven" + triō, that is "the seven plough-oxen (stars of Ursa Major). triō (pl. triōnes) is problematic. Most sources give this as meaning "plough-oxen", but this term for plough-oxen is used nowhere else in Latin. A few sources posit that triō < PIE *(s)tē̆r- "star" with loss of initial s as in Indic, and that later mythology led people to reinterpret the root as "oxen". The transparent meaning of this word to the Romans was "in the direction of the constellation the Plough (Ursa Major)". L auster (adj. austrālis) was the Latin name of the South Wind and the South. Now here is a fascinating bit of history and its relation to language change. Most scholars believe that auster < PIE *-aus "shine" - which is the same root that gives rise to the words for "dawn" and "east" in other IE languages! How can the same root be used for different cardinal directions in sister languages? One theory is that since the Italian peninsula runs diagonally NW-SE, the word for "east" shifted to mean "south" since both were in the direction of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Another theory is that since the lands to the South were burning hot, or alternatively since the sirocco was hot, the root *aus- referred to this heat. 

In Old English the three rhymes were not yet homophones. The /a/ in the night etymon had raised to /i/ under palatal umlaut, causing it to rhyme with wight: 

Gk ἕσπερος hesperos was found in Greek, cognate to Latin vesper and Germanic west. ἕσπερος < PIE *wesperos/wekeros "evening" < *wes "wind, blow" + *pero "source". In origin this may have been something like "the direction from which the wind blows"; one can imagine that this is possibly a reference to the prevailing winds in the PIE urheimat. 

The reason the three words are spelled similarly in Modern English is that they rhymed in Middle English. The reason they rhymed in Middle English despite differing etymologies is that they underwent regular predictable phonological mergers: West L occidēns (adj. occidentālis) was the usual Latin term. The meaning was similarly transparent in Latin: "going down/setting", viz. "in the direction of the setting sun". occidēns is the present participle of occidō, "fall/go down" < ob “towards/facing” + cadō "fall” < Proto-Indo-European *ḱad- “fall”.
