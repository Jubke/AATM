Alec had two 5K that are hidden from the dealer and every player but the player to his right. Facing an all in is problematic: NOT hands you play short stacked. Don't bluff with total dogs unless you have a read they will fold. A hand like 53s rather than 72o. Give yourself a chance at a call and miracle flop to stack them. Some people have already answered but I was thinking MTT no limit and 30+ bb. The down side is need to play pot control on a monster - up to a point. If you just call with AA pre from mid and it gets raised behind you then OK to get it in pre. You got called on the flop. You both checked the turn. Why did you check the river? Any hand that will fold to a raise is going to check there. You need to gamble more at heads up. I get the feeling you are not comfortable with gambling. If villain got in late and for a good price that flop is in their range. If villain was BB he got in for 3:1. If villain is on a flush draw they have more outs. Since any pair is an out they are on 15 outs. If you try and price them out then you have priced yourself out. On the flop you have nothing but Ace high and a gut shot straight draw. There is no reason to build a pot here. Your Ace has some show down value. If you call the flush cards dead you only have 5 outs (3 3s and 2 Aces). I noticed some pros just min raise and play almost every hand and get called almost every hand. This article advises 2-3 BB. So I looked at pots odds again. UTG+2 even if he has flush have outs to a boat UTG+2 set is probably good - charge em I think Alec was careless if not reckless in having chips hidden. They were not hidden from him - not like he did not know they were hidden. Do I think he was angling? No, but he should not have let that situation happen. He is a pro and coach.
