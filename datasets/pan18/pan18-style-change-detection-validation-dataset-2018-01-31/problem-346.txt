They see an article about a micro-expression, and now everytime they see someone twitch they think it's a bluff. That twitch is only relative to a baseline of actual information. With only a few bluffs and many, many value combinations in villains range, check-folding is usually the best choice. $6 NL (6 max) - Holdem - 6 players Flop: ($55, 2 players) A♠ Q♠ 3♣ Hero checks, CO bets $42, Hero calls $42 I'm a little stuck at the Turn as i'm unsure of what is best? I have similar feelings about the River although I think it's not quite as difficult given the pot odds. Villain is 20/17/10% 3bet. AF 3. Over 93 hands. Less positionally aware than average. I've seen him 3bet light with 96s but not from this positional situation. He's what I'd consider TAG-ish. Bots, if they are run by the host, still have to perform effectively. Lots of research into this via University of Alberta poker AI group describes just how difficult this is. I'm sure it's against almost all sites T&C's to allow bots on their networks so I'd say it's very unlikely, if not too difficult to be wothwhile.

I like upvoting stuff, so please do your best to make it worth it!] I've made a few of these questions now, and it seems that either some people aren't bothered to put more detailed analysis into their answers or they aren't sure how to. I should say that short answers aren't that useful. Anyone can do that! I can do that!! What I'm looking for and hoping will become the standard are detailed answers that use some range analysis, possible equity analysis (if applicable). I've done the detailed analysis myself, but I'm asking it here because I'd like to get the communities input as well.
