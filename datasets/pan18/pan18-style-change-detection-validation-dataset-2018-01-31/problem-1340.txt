You are to be holy to me because I, the LORD, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be my own. 

5 The arrogant cannot stand in your presence. You hate all who do wrong; Edit: to show that God is also a God that Hates. 

God does not dwell with us today like he dwelt with the Israelites, in the temple. God is teaching us how to love these days, when before He was forcing the Israelites to be Pure and Holy. Don't get me wrong we still have a responsibility to be Pure and Holy, but the land we live in is not. God is a God of Love. God is also a God of Hate. If you love you must also hate. If you love children then you will hate abortion. God is angry with those enemies of his that practice sin. Here is a verse that describes the anger that God has towards sinners. 11 God is a just judge, And God is angry with the wicked every day. God is unchanging, He does not want wicked people corrupting you. The reason that he commanded these wicked people to be killed in Numbers is because God wanted Israel to be a Holy land, a nation that could not put up with even the smallest Sins. In Mathew 5:39 God is talking to His obedient children, He's teaching them to forgive their enemies. A completely different context from the previous situation of holiness. In the New Testament this author is upholding the understanding of of the Old Testament, that we should be a Holy people. But this author tells us to not associate ourselves with unholy people, instead of just killing the unholy people. Yes, the God of Calvinism is loving and no, there is never a time when his actions are not loving. This includes hell. The problem with your question is not the doctrine of omnipresence, but the doctrine of hell. You state: 

There is a sense in which an attribute which is an action is not fully realized until it is enacted. Love isn't real without an object of affection. Forgiveness is ethereal until somebody has crossed you. Being a redeemer requires something to save. For any of those created things to focus on themselves rather than on the one-preeminent-being is sin. Being ego-centric is rightly considered to be a bad attribute when applied to a human, but not when speaking of God. 

The absolutely crazy "exception" to this -- and it's technically not an exception at all because his love is consistent even in this case -- is the forgiveness and reconciliation of sinners to himself through the sacrifice of Jesus. By himself becoming subject to the curse of sin and wrath of God against evil when he himself was good, he earned the right to buy back those whom he chose from death -- to experience God's love of good as one of those good things rather than experiencing his love for good things expressed as his hatred of bad things. I believe God is a full-on egoist in that his is fully self centered. Whatever he does he does for himself, and he expects/demands the same of others. Egoist can also have another connotation of being conceited and limited to caring about ones-self. I am not reffering to this. Being omnipotent it's impossible for God to have a delusional or exaggerated sense of self worth. If you leave out the definition of of megalomania that includes being delusional, I think it is safe to say that God is a megalomaniac in so-far as he is obsessed with his own power and importance. Almost every major Creed in Christian history has some statement about this aspect of God. For example the Athanasian Creede, a very old and widely used one identifies Christian believe about God in this way: But where does that idea come from in the Bible? The problem with hell is that God is there! It is where God pours out his eternal judgement on all things evil. This is a part of his nature and God's wrath will be a very present reality of hell for all eternity. While we can't paint an exact picture of hell, we do have have some fairly vivid and specific descriptions of the way God is involved in punishment: The loving nature of God is, according to Calvinism and Reformed theology in general, both perfect and immutable. There is no time in which he is not loving nor action which does not display his love. 

To begin with lets start by defining what the three parts of man (and woman) are: Luke 19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. From the King James translation; There are several Scriptures which tell us that God is Omnipotent, Not the least of which is creation itself. 

He also caused wood soaked with massive amounts of water to burn when he sent fire from Heaven. 

In the above passage Jesus is telling us His power is given to him by the Father. Unless Jesus were God and not just a good man all of these would be hollow promises, since salvation is of God: I will give you what my understanding is concerning the Spirit as I understand the Scriptures. 

God stopped the Rain for three years, at the behest of Elijah. Why would the Spirit experience the wrath of God? What would be the purpose of punishing the Soul for eternity if it had no memory of being informed about the Grace of God and yet rejecting that free gift of God? Mark 2:17 When Jesus heard [it], he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
