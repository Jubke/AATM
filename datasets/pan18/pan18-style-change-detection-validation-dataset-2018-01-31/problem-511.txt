Is there any chance the vote locking could be lifted (or at least relaxed) for elections? Having said that, I'm not in favour of rep for comments. It would change how they were seen and used. They are there to ask for clarification etc. and as such can become obsolete and should be deleted. If they earned reputation people might post even more "clever" comments to try to earn that reputation. Given that the latest global reputation recalculation generated the usual spate of "Where's my reputation gone?" questions is it time to revisit the idea of performing periodic recalculations so people get used to the idea of reputation going down as well as up? EDIT by waffles This is now implemented for all 20k users. We get the occasional network spammer who creates accounts on several sites to post their spam. I tried to revoke the vote but was told that the vote was locked (as is expected as the nominations are effectively questions). Just out of idle curiosity I thought I'd check how many of my answers had been accepted. The only way I could see was to manually count. Can we get a link to [legal] - https://stackexchange.com/legal - and include the first part of section 3 (about the use of content) included in the "defacing content" mod message template? I originally suggested prefixing the post with this, but it has been suggested in the comments that it's added at the end. Personally, I've got no problem with that - I just thought of prefixing first. There's also the "copy profile to all accounts" option to consider. It would have to know which accounts to ignore. A person deleting a few zero or low scoring posts on one day is probably just cleaning up their account. When visiting a site where a user doesn't have an account, the "How does SE work" 1 banner doesn't really need to be shown to users who have accounts on other sites. If you've been on the network for any length of time then you should really know how SE works.
