Also, as Juan Manuel pointed out in the comment to your question, sharing your steam games is prohibited as per their terms of service. Seeing how New Vegas simply relies on Steam for DRM and you are talking about retail copies this may not be the same case, but it's something else to consider. 

Assuming the above is true, you could install the game on your son's machine, activate it one time using your account and then he should be able to play without needing to connect to steam. Mind you, that just because further authentication isn't required, it doesn't necessarily mean that the game won't try to perform it anyway. 

Strictly speaking, once you've tied the older game to your steam account you can't really give it away through Steam (as I am sure you know). 

To clarify, this is where I'd like to comment: 

A friend of mine made a purchase I wholeheartedly approve of on Steam, and I would like to congratulate them on their wise decision. I'd also like to toss in a semi-personal question while I'm at it, so I was wondering: If I comment on a friend's activity, who can see said comment? Just the friend? My friend's friends? My friends? Everybody? 

As long as the SteamApps folder layout is the same for all systems you'll be using, there will be no problems with installation. Possible problems with this include savegames inside the game folders, patching from multiple computers at the same time and that installing and deleting games requires you to restart Steam on other computers. 

The problem is some games check with Steam that the currently signed in user has bought the game. DRM biting you in the backside. 

Per game option You can now tell Steam to continue downloading updates/games while playing games from your games' properties. Note that this setting is not available for non-steam games, which will always use the global setting. 

You simply need to enable Family Sharing on the computer you want to use: 

Also note that not all games support this system, or have only partial support. For example, you cannot participate in CS:GO's competitive matchmaking while borrowing the game from another account. Most games with 3rd party DRM, such as Uplay, will cause issues and might not even show up on the list.

While I have no knowledge of the extent of Steam integration a retail version of New Vegas possesses, the following article claims that: 

This is all assuming your son has his own machine, of course.

Short Answer Install game on external Unplug external > error (missing executable) Plug in external > game works Unplug external and restart Steam > game offers & requires installation Plug in external > game offers & requires installation Restart Steam > game works Installing to the same directory when it offers & requires installation detects the game and the game will work.

I have the soundtrack for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth installed through Steam: 

I wrote this AutoHotkey script to generate shortcuts (no icon images though) 

Where can I find it in order to listen to when I'm not playing? I found a packed music.a file, but that's intentionally encrypted according to the readme in the same folder, and so it is unusable in a music player, including Steam's own music player. 

Then, I unplugged the external drive and restarted Steam. The game was listed as uninstalled. After plugging in the external drive, the game remained as uninstalled, and launching it would prompt installation (in addition to creating a new Steam library on the external drive). Installing to the same directory at this point immediately installs the game and it starts working again.
