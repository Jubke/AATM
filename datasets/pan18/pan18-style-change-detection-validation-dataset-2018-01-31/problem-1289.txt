Centering diphthongs are not a "myth" per se: they really exist/existed in some English accents. These accents are not universal, obviously: they are/were only used by certain groups of speakers in certain historical periods. It's true that many modern British English speakers use monophthongs, not centering diphthongs, in words like care, beer, pure. You can find a description of this in Geoff Lindsey's blog post The British English vowel system, which tries to describe the phonetic differences between what he calls "Standard Southern British" and Received Pronunciation as transcribed by Gimson. In that post, he transcribes the vowel of square as /ɛː/, the vowel of near as /ɪː/ or disyllabic /ɪjə/ = FLEECE followed by COMMA, and the vowel of pure as /ɵː/, /oː/, or disyllabic /ʉwə/ = GOOSE followed by COMMA. 

I have found several sources that treat this etymology as speculative; for example: stem - affix = base base + affix = stem the pronunciation with /ɪiː/ listed in the OED is older, and it was simplified to /iː/ over time, as in the word medi(a)eval or caries. This seems unlikely to me, since /ˈhɪdʒɪiːn/ > /ˈhɪdʒiːn/ requires another step to change the /ɪ/ in the first syllable to /aɪ/ before we get the modern pronunciation the pronunciation with /iː/ was a direct anglicization of the French pronunciation by analogy with the vowels used in word pairs like English piece /piːs/–French pièce /pjɛs(ə)/ or English relief /rəˈliːf/–French relief /rəljɛf/. The /aɪ/ in the first syllable is based purely on the spelling. the pronunciation with /iː/ was a direct anglicization based purely on the French spelling (by analogy with the use of the digraph "ie" to represent /iː/ in various English words, not only French-derived ones like piece and relief but also field, yield etc.) The /aɪ/ in the first syllable is based purely on the spelling. I know the last two are fairly similar, and probably hard to distinguish based on evidence. In fact, if I had to guess, I would say the modern pronunciation most likely originates from a mixture of 2 & 3. However, I'm just an amateur. I'd love to know if any professional etymologists or linguists have said anything about the development of this word. 

I also found the following exchange on the talk page of the Wiktionary article for the Proto-Germanic equivalent ga-: This is native-speaker bias at work, Czech phonemes aren't actually especially easy to distinguish in general if you don't speak Czech natively. For French, [dʒ] and [tʃ] can equally be said to exist or not exist. Normal native French words do not have either of these affricates, since historically they were simplified to the fricatives [ʒ] (usually spelled g or j) and [ʃ] (usually spelled ch). However, due to the influence of foreign languages, phonetic affricates [dʒ] (spelled dj) and [tʃ] (spelled tch) do exist in some modern French words, names and expressions, such as djaïn "Jain" and tchao "bye." It's possible that phonologically these can be considered consonant clusters composed of a plosive phoneme and a fricative phoneme, like /ps/ in psychologie or /gz/ in xylophone. Czech has an unusually rich array of palatal or historically palatalized sounds that are phonemically distinct and may be difficult for speakers of other languages to distinguish, such as the distinctions between all of /d/, /ɟ/, /j/, /ʒ/, /z/, /r̝/. Listening to the video you linked to, I as a native English speaker had a hard time hearing the difference between "eř" and "eš". 

For Spanish, the phoneme /ʝ/ often sounds similar to English /dʒ/. Wikipedia's article on Spanish phonology says that in standard Castillian, this phoneme is realized as an affricate [ɟʝ] after a pause or after a nasal or lateral consonant. This is very similar phonetically to [dʒ], and I believe some Spanish dialects do just use [dʒ] (in others, [dʒ] has been changed by lenition to [ʒ], which may then be devoiced to [ʃ]). In general, more intellectual, fancy, rarely-used terms are more likely to have been brought closer to the Latin forms in this way, and the more common, everyday and ordinary words are more likely to have changed and diverged the most from Latin. There are many noun-adjective pairs in French where the noun has some sound changes that were reversed or resisted on the adjective: a relevant example for this particular sound change is the pair école-scolaire, where we see that the noun has the excrescent e- and has lost the "s" while the adjective simply has the same initial consonant cluster as the Classical Latin word. When glossing a logical proposition with English words, we are not really using the English language system; it's just a way to represent the unambiguous mathematical concepts in a mnemonic and easy-to-pronounce manner. For this reason, mathematicians and logicians like to present specialized definitions of the words they use. That is what is being done in this passage. You'll only confuse yourself if you try to use the ordinary meaning of English words in this context. In native Japanese words, this sound etymologically derives from lenition of the bilabial stop /p/, and there is evidence (such as Portuguese transcriptions that use f) that at one point it was pronounced as [ɸ] (a bilabial voiceless fricative) before all vowels.
